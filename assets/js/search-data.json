Elsinore.ACT ISCENE I. Elsinore. A platform before the Castle. Enter Francisco and Barnardo, two sentinels.BARNARDO. Whoâ€™s there?FRANCISCO. Nay, answer me. Stand and unfold yourself.BARNARDO. Long live the King!FRANCISCO. Barnardo?BARNARDO. He.FRANCISCO. You come most carefully upon your hour.BARNARDO. â€™Tis now struck twelve. Get thee to bed, Francisco.FRANCISCO. For this relief much thanks. â€™Tis bitter cold, And I am sickat heart.BARNARDO. Have you had quiet guard?FRANCISCO. Not a mouse stirring.BARNARDO. Well, good night. If you do meet Horatio and Marcellus, Therivals of my watch, bid them make haste. Enter Horatio and Marcellus.FRANCISCO. I think I hear them. Stand, ho! Who is there?HORATIO. Friends to this ground.MARCELLUS. And liegemen to the Dane.FRANCISCO. Give you good night.MARCELLUS. O, farewell, honest soldier, who hath relievâ€™d you?FRANCISCO. Barnardo has my place. Give you good-night. [_Exit._]MARCELLUS. Holla, Barnardo!BARNARDO. Say, what, is Horatio there?HORATIO. A piece of him.BARNARDO. Welcome, Horatio. Welcome, good Marcellus.MARCELLUS. What, has this thing appearâ€™d again tonight?BARNARDO. I have seen nothing.MARCELLUS. Horatio says â€™tis but our fantasy, And will not let belieftake hold of him Touching this dreaded sight, twice seen of us.Therefore I have entreated him along With us to watch the minutes ofthis night, That if again this apparition come He may approve our eyesand speak to it.HORATIO. Tush, tush, â€™twill not appear.BARNARDO. Sit down awhile, And let us once again assail your ears, Thatare so fortified against our story, What we two nights have seen.HORATIO. Well, sit we down, And let us hear Barnardo speak of this.BARNARDO. Last night of all, When yond same star thatâ€™s westward fromthe pole, Had made his course tâ€™illume that part of heaven Where now itburns, Marcellus and myself, The bell then beating oneâ€”MARCELLUS. Peace, break thee off. Look where it comes again. Enter Ghost.BARNARDO. In the same figure, like the King thatâ€™s dead.MARCELLUS. Thou art a scholar; speak to it, Horatio.BARNARDO. Looks it not like the King? Mark it, Horatio.HORATIO. Most like. It harrows me with fear and wonder.BARNARDO It would be spoke to.MARCELLUS. Question it, Horatio.HORATIO. What art thou that usurpâ€™st this time of night, Together withthat fair and warlike form In which the majesty of buried Denmark Didsometimes march? By heaven I charge thee speak.MARCELLUS. It is offended.BARNARDO. See, it stalks away.HORATIO. Stay! speak, speak! I charge thee speak! [_Exit Ghost._]MARCELLUS. â€™Tis gone, and will not answer.BARNARDO. How now, Horatio! You tremble and look pale. Is not thissomething more than fantasy? What think you onâ€™t?HORATIO. Before my God, I might not this believe Without the sensibleand true avouch Of mine own eyes.MARCELLUS. Is it not like the King?HORATIO. As thou art to thyself: Such was the very armour he had onWhen he thâ€™ambitious Norway combated; So frownâ€™d he once, when in anangry parle He smote the sledded Polacks on the ice. â€™Tis strange.MARCELLUS. Thus twice before, and jump at this dead hour, With martialstalk hath he gone by our watch.HORATIO. In what particular thought to work I know not; But in thegross and scope of my opinion, This bodes some strange eruption to ourstate.MARCELLUS. Good now, sit down, and tell me, he that knows, Why thissame strict and most observant watch So nightly toils the subject ofthe land, And why such daily cast of brazen cannon And foreign mart forimplements of war; Why such impress of shipwrights, whose sore taskDoes not divide the Sunday from the week. What might be toward, thatthis sweaty haste Doth make the night joint-labourer with the day: Whoisâ€™t that can inform me?HORATIO. That can I; At least, the whisper goes so. Our last King,Whose image even but now appearâ€™d to us, Was, as you know, byFortinbras of Norway, Thereto prickâ€™d on by a most emulate pride, Darâ€™dto the combat; in which our valiant Hamlet, For so this side of ourknown world esteemâ€™d him, Did slay this Fortinbras; who by a sealâ€™dcompact, Well ratified by law and heraldry, Did forfeit, with his life,all those his lands Which he stood seizâ€™d of, to the conqueror; Againstthe which, a moiety competent Was gaged by our King; which had returnâ€™dTo the inheritance of Fortinbras, Had he been vanquisher; as by thesame covâ€™nant And carriage of the article designâ€™d, His fell to Hamlet.Now, sir, young Fortinbras, Of unimproved mettle, hot and full, Hath inthe skirts of Norway, here and there, Sharkâ€™d up a list of lawlessresolutes, For food and diet, to some enterprise That hath a stomachinâ€™t; which is no other, As it doth well appear unto our state, But torecover of us by strong hand And terms compulsatory, those foresaidlands So by his father lost. And this, I take it, Is the main motive ofour preparations, The source of this our watch, and the chief head Ofthis post-haste and rummage in the land.BARNARDO. I think it be no other but eâ€™en so: Well may it sort thatthis portentous figure Comes armed through our watch so like the KingThat was and is the question of these wars.HORATIO. A mote it is to trouble the mindâ€™s eye. In the most high andpalmy state of Rome, A little ere the mightiest Julius fell, The gravesstood tenantless and the sheeted dead Did squeak and gibber in theRoman streets; As stars with trains of fire and dews of blood,Disasters in the sun; and the moist star, Upon whose influenceNeptuneâ€™s empire stands, Was sick almost to doomsday with eclipse. Andeven the like precurse of fierce events, As harbingers preceding stillthe fates And prologue to the omen coming on, Have heaven and earthtogether demonstrated Unto our climatures and countrymen. Re-enter Ghost.But, soft, behold! Lo, where it comes again! Iâ€™ll cross it, though itblast me. Stay, illusion! If thou hast any sound, or use of voice,Speak to me. If there be any good thing to be done, That may to thee doease, and grace to me, Speak to me. If thou art privy to thy countryâ€™sfate, Which, happily, foreknowing may avoid, O speak! Or if thou hastuphoarded in thy life Extorted treasure in the womb of earth, Forwhich, they say, you spirits oft walk in death, Speak of it. Stay, andspeak! [_The cock crows._]Stop it, Marcellus!MARCELLUS. Shall I strike at it with my partisan?HORATIO. Do, if it will not stand.BARNARDO. â€™Tis here!HORATIO. â€™Tis here! [_Exit Ghost._]MARCELLUS. â€™Tis gone! We do it wrong, being so majestical, To offer itthe show of violence, For it is as the air, invulnerable, And our vainblows malicious mockery.BARNARDO. It was about to speak, when the cock crew.HORATIO. And then it started, like a guilty thing Upon a fearfulsummons. I have heard The cock, that is the trumpet to the morn, Dothwith his lofty and shrill-sounding throat Awake the god of day; and athis warning, Whether in sea or fire, in earth or air, Thâ€™extravagantand erring spirit hies To his confine. And of the truth herein Thispresent object made probation.MARCELLUS. It faded on the crowing of the cock. Some say that everâ€™gainst that season comes Wherein our Saviourâ€™s birth is celebrated,The bird of dawning singeth all night long; And then, they say, nospirit dare stir abroad, The nights are wholesome, then no planetsstrike, No fairy takes, nor witch hath power to charm; So hallowâ€™d andso gracious is the time.HORATIO. So have I heard, and do in part believe it. But look, the mornin russet mantle clad, Walks oâ€™er the dew of yon high eastward hill.Break we our watch up, and by my advice, Let us impart what we haveseen tonight Unto young Hamlet; for upon my life, This spirit, dumb tous, will speak to him. Do you consent we shall acquaint him with it, Asneedful in our loves, fitting our duty?MARCELLUS. Letâ€™s doâ€™t, I pray, and I this morning know Where we shallfind him most conveniently. [_Exeunt._]SCENE II. Elsinore. A room of state in the Castle. Enter Claudius King of Denmark, Gertrude the Queen, Hamlet, Polonius, Laertes, Voltemand, Cornelius, Lords and Attendant.KING. Though yet of Hamlet our dear brotherâ€™s death The memory begreen, and that it us befitted To bear our hearts in grief, and ourwhole kingdom To be contracted in one brow of woe; Yet so far hathdiscretion fought with nature That we with wisest sorrow think on him,Together with remembrance of ourselves. Therefore our sometime sister,now our queen, Thâ€™imperial jointress to this warlike state, Have we, asâ€™twere with a defeated joy, With one auspicious and one dropping eye,With mirth in funeral, and with dirge in marriage, In equal scaleweighing delight and dole, Taken to wife; nor have we herein barrâ€™dYour better wisdoms, which have freely gone With this affair along. Forall, our thanks. Now follows, that you know young Fortinbras, Holding aweak supposal of our worth, Or thinking by our late dear brotherâ€™sdeath Our state to be disjoint and out of frame, Colleagued with thisdream of his advantage, He hath not failâ€™d to pester us with message,Importing the surrender of those lands Lost by his father, with allbonds of law, To our most valiant brother. So much for him. Now forourself and for this time of meeting: Thus much the business is: wehave here writ To Norway, uncle of young Fortinbras, Who, impotent andbed-rid, scarcely hears Of this his nephewâ€™s purpose, to suppress Hisfurther gait herein; in that the levies, The lists, and fullproportions are all made Out of his subject: and we here dispatch You,good Cornelius, and you, Voltemand, For bearers of this greeting to oldNorway, Giving to you no further personal power To business with theKing, more than the scope Of these dilated articles allow. Farewell;and let your haste commend your duty.CORNELIUS and VOLTEMAND. In that, and all things, will we show ourduty.KING. We doubt it nothing: heartily farewell. [_Exeunt Voltemand and Cornelius._]And now, Laertes, whatâ€™s the news with you? You told us of some suit.What isâ€™t, Laertes? You cannot speak of reason to the Dane, And loseyour voice. What wouldst thou beg, Laertes, That shall not be my offer,not thy asking? The head is not more native to the heart, The hand moreinstrumental to the mouth, Than is the throne of Denmark to thy father.What wouldst thou have, Laertes?LAERTES. Dread my lord, Your leave and favour to return to France, Fromwhence though willingly I came to Denmark To show my duty in yourcoronation; Yet now I must confess, that duty done, My thoughts andwishes bend again toward France, And bow them to your gracious leaveand pardon.KING. Have you your fatherâ€™s leave? What says Polonius?POLONIUS. He hath, my lord, wrung from me my slow leave By laboursomepetition; and at last Upon his will I sealâ€™d my hard consent. I dobeseech you give him leave to go.KING. Take thy fair hour, Laertes; time be thine, And thy best gracesspend it at thy will! But now, my cousin Hamlet, and my sonâ€”HAMLET. [_Aside._] A little more than kin, and less than kind.KING. How is it that the clouds still hang on you?HAMLET. Not so, my lord, I am too much iâ€™ the sun.QUEEN. Good Hamlet, cast thy nighted colour off, And let thine eye looklike a friend on Denmark. Do not for ever with thy vailed lids Seek forthy noble father in the dust. Thou knowâ€™st â€™tis common, all that livesmust die, Passing through nature to eternity.HAMLET. Ay, madam, it is common.QUEEN. If it be, Why seems it so particular with thee?HAMLET. Seems, madam! Nay, it is; I know not seems. â€™Tis not alone myinky cloak, good mother, Nor customary suits of solemn black, Nor windysuspiration of forcâ€™d breath, No, nor the fruitful river in the eye,Nor the dejected haviour of the visage, Together with all forms, moods,shows of grief, That can denote me truly. These indeed seem, For theyare actions that a man might play; But I have that within which passethshow; These but the trappings and the suits of woe.KING. â€™Tis sweet and commendable in your nature, Hamlet, To give thesemourning duties to your father; But you must know, your father lost afather, That father lost, lost his, and the survivor bound In filialobligation, for some term To do obsequious sorrow. But to persevere Inobstinate condolement is a course Of impious stubbornness. â€™Tis unmanlygrief, It shows a will most incorrect to heaven, A heart unfortified, amind impatient, An understanding simple and unschoolâ€™d; For what weknow must be, and is as common As any the most vulgar thing to sense,Why should we in our peevish opposition Take it to heart? Fie, â€™tis afault to heaven, A fault against the dead, a fault to nature, To reasonmost absurd, whose common theme Is death of fathers, and who still hathcried, From the first corse till he that died today, â€˜This must be so.â€™We pray you throw to earth This unprevailing woe, and think of us As ofa father; for let the world take note You are the most immediate to ourthrone, And with no less nobility of love Than that which dearestfather bears his son Do I impart toward you. For your intent In goingback to school in Wittenberg, It is most retrograde to our desire: Andwe beseech you bend you to remain Here in the cheer and comfort of oureye, Our chiefest courtier, cousin, and our son.QUEEN. Let not thy mother lose her prayers, Hamlet. I pray thee staywith us; go not to Wittenberg.HAMLET. I shall in all my best obey you, madam.KING. Why, â€™tis a loving and a fair reply. Be as ourself in Denmark.Madam, come; This gentle and unforcâ€™d accord of Hamlet Sits smiling tomy heart; in grace whereof, No jocund health that Denmark drinks todayBut the great cannon to the clouds shall tell, And the Kingâ€™s rouse theheaven shall bruit again, Re-speaking earthly thunder. Come away. [_Exeunt all but Hamlet._]HAMLET. O that this too too solid flesh would melt, Thaw, and resolveitself into a dew! Or that the Everlasting had not fixâ€™d His canonâ€™gainst self-slaughter. O God! O God! How weary, stale, flat, andunprofitable Seem to me all the uses of this world! Fie onâ€™t! Oh fie!â€™tis an unweeded garden That grows to seed; things rank and gross innature Possess it merely. That it should come to this! But two monthsdeadâ€”nay, not so much, not two: So excellent a king; that was to thisHyperion to a satyr; so loving to my mother, That he might not beteemthe winds of heaven Visit her face too roughly. Heaven and earth! MustI remember? Why, she would hang on him As if increase of appetite hadgrown By what it fed on; and yet, within a monthâ€” Let me not thinkonâ€™tâ€”Frailty, thy name is woman! A little month, or ere those shoeswere old With which she followed my poor fatherâ€™s body Like Niobe, alltears.â€”Why she, even sheâ€” O God! A beast that wants discourse of reasonWould have mournâ€™d longer,â€”married with mine uncle, My fatherâ€™sbrother; but no more like my father Than I to Hercules. Within a month?Ere yet the salt of most unrighteous tears Had left the flushing in hergalled eyes, She married. O most wicked speed, to post With suchdexterity to incestuous sheets! It is not, nor it cannot come to good.But break my heart, for I must hold my tongue. Enter Horatio, Marcellus and Barnardo.HORATIO. Hail to your lordship!HAMLET. I am glad to see you well: Horatio, or I do forget myself.HORATIO. The same, my lord, And your poor servant ever.HAMLET. Sir, my good friend; Iâ€™ll change that name with you: And whatmake you from Wittenberg, Horatio?â€” Marcellus?MARCELLUS. My good lord.HAMLET. I am very glad to see you.â€”Good even, sir.â€” But what, in faith,make you from Wittenberg?HORATIO. A truant disposition, good my lord.HAMLET. I would not hear your enemy say so; Nor shall you do my earthat violence, To make it truster of your own report Against yourself.I know you are no truant. But what is your affair in Elsinore? Weâ€™llteach you to drink deep ere you depart.HORATIO. My lord, I came to see your fatherâ€™s funeral.HAMLET. I prithee do not mock me, fellow-student. I think it was to seemy motherâ€™s wedding.HORATIO. Indeed, my lord, it followâ€™d hard upon.HAMLET. Thrift, thrift, Horatio! The funeral bakâ€™d meats Did coldlyfurnish forth the marriage tables. Would I had met my dearest foe inheaven Or ever I had seen that day, Horatio. My father,â€”methinks I seemy father.HORATIO. Where, my lord?HAMLET. In my mindâ€™s eye, Horatio.HORATIO. I saw him once; he was a goodly king.HAMLET. He was a man, take him for all in all, I shall not look uponhis like again.HORATIO. My lord, I think I saw him yesternight.HAMLET. Saw? Who?HORATIO. My lord, the King your father.HAMLET. The King my father!HORATIO. Season your admiration for a while With an attent ear, till Imay deliver Upon the witness of these gentlemen This marvel to you.HAMLET. For Godâ€™s love let me hear.HORATIO. Two nights together had these gentlemen, Marcellus andBarnardo, on their watch In the dead waste and middle of the night,Been thus encounterâ€™d. A figure like your father, Armed at pointexactly, cap-Ã xa0-pie, Appears before them, and with solemn march Goesslow and stately by them: thrice he walkâ€™d By their oppressâ€™d andfear-surprised eyes, Within his truncheonâ€™s length; whilst they,distillâ€™d Almost to jelly with the act of fear, Stand dumb, and speaknot to him. This to me In dreadful secrecy impart they did, And I withthem the third night kept the watch, Where, as they had deliverâ€™d, bothin time, Form of the thing, each word made true and good, Theapparition comes. I knew your father; These hands are not more like.HAMLET. But where was this?MARCELLUS. My lord, upon the platform where we watch.HAMLET. Did you not speak to it?HORATIO. My lord, I did; But answer made it none: yet once methought Itlifted up it head, and did address Itself to motion, like as it wouldspeak. But even then the morning cock crew loud, And at the sound itshrunk in haste away, And vanishâ€™d from our sight.HAMLET. â€™Tis very strange.HORATIO. As I do live, my honourâ€™d lord, â€™tis true; And we did think itwrit down in our duty To let you know of it.HAMLET. Indeed, indeed, sirs, but this troubles me. Hold you the watchtonight?Mar. and BARNARDO. We do, my lord.HAMLET. Armâ€™d, say you?Both. Armâ€™d, my lord.HAMLET. From top to toe?BOTH. My lord, from head to foot.HAMLET. Then saw you not his face?HORATIO. O yes, my lord, he wore his beaver up.HAMLET. What, lookâ€™d he frowningly?HORATIO. A countenance more in sorrow than in anger.HAMLET. Pale, or red?HORATIO. Nay, very pale.HAMLET. And fixâ€™d his eyes upon you?HORATIO. Most constantly.HAMLET. I would I had been there.HORATIO. It would have much amazâ€™d you.HAMLET. Very like, very like. Stayâ€™d it long?HORATIO. While one with moderate haste might tell a hundred.MARCELLUS and BARNARDO. Longer, longer.HORATIO. Not when I sawâ€™t.HAMLET. His beard was grizzled, no?HORATIO. It was, as I have seen it in his life, A sable silverâ€™d.HAMLET. I will watch tonight; Perchance â€™twill walk again.HORATIO. I warrant you it will.HAMLET. If it assume my noble fatherâ€™s person, Iâ€™ll speak to it, thoughhell itself should gape And bid me hold my peace. I pray you all, Ifyou have hitherto concealâ€™d this sight, Let it be tenable in yoursilence still; And whatsoever else shall hap tonight, Give it anunderstanding, but no tongue. I will requite your loves. So, fare yewell. Upon the platform â€™twixt eleven and twelve, Iâ€™ll visit you.ALL. Our duty to your honour.HAMLET. Your loves, as mine to you: farewell. [_Exeunt Horatio, Marcellus and Barnardo._]My fatherâ€™s spirit in arms! All is not well; I doubt some foul play:would the night were come! Till then sit still, my soul: foul deedswill rise, Though all the earth oâ€™erwhelm them, to menâ€™s eyes. [_Exit._]SCENE III. A room in Poloniusâ€™s house. Enter Laertes and Ophelia.LAERTES. My necessaries are embarkâ€™d. Farewell. And, sister, as thewinds give benefit And convoy is assistant, do not sleep, But let mehear from you.OPHELIA. Do you doubt that?LAERTES. For Hamlet, and the trifling of his favour, Hold it a fashionand a toy in blood; A violet in the youth of primy nature, Forward, notpermanent, sweet, not lasting; The perfume and suppliance of a minute;No more.OPHELIA. No more but so?LAERTES. Think it no more. For nature crescent does not grow alone Inthews and bulk; but as this temple waxes, The inward service of themind and soul Grows wide withal. Perhaps he loves you now, And now nosoil nor cautel doth besmirch The virtue of his will; but you mustfear, His greatness weighâ€™d, his will is not his own; For he himself issubject to his birth: He may not, as unvaluâ€™d persons do, Carve forhimself; for on his choice depends The sanctity and health of thiswhole state; And therefore must his choice be circumscribâ€™d Unto thevoice and yielding of that body Whereof he is the head. Then if he sayshe loves you, It fits your wisdom so far to believe it As he in hisparticular act and place May give his saying deed; which is no furtherThan the main voice of Denmark goes withal. Then weigh what loss yourhonour may sustain If with too credent ear you list his songs, Or loseyour heart, or your chaste treasure open To his unmasterâ€™d importunity.Fear it, Ophelia, fear it, my dear sister; And keep you in the rear ofyour affection, Out of the shot and danger of desire. The chariest maidis prodigal enough If she unmask her beauty to the moon. Virtue itselfscopes not calumnious strokes: The canker galls the infants of thespring Too oft before their buttons be disclosâ€™d, And in the morn andliquid dew of youth Contagious blastments are most imminent. Be warythen, best safety lies in fear. Youth to itself rebels, though noneelse near.OPHELIA. I shall thâ€™effect of this good lesson keep As watchman to myheart. But good my brother, Do not as some ungracious pastors do, Showme the steep and thorny way to heaven; Whilst like a puffâ€™d andreckless libertine Himself the primrose path of dalliance treads, Andrecks not his own rede.LAERTES. O, fear me not. I stay too long. But here my father comes. Enter Polonius.A double blessing is a double grace; Occasion smiles upon a secondleave.POLONIUS. Yet here, Laertes? Aboard, aboard, for shame. The wind sitsin the shoulder of your sail, And you are stayâ€™d for. There, myblessing with you. [_Laying his hand on Laertesâ€™s head._]And these few precepts in thy memory Look thou character. Give thythoughts no tongue, Nor any unproportionâ€™d thought his act. Be thoufamiliar, but by no means vulgar. Those friends thou hast, and theiradoption tried, Grapple them unto thy soul with hoops of steel; But donot dull thy palm with entertainment Of each new-hatchâ€™d, unfledgâ€™dcomrade. Beware Of entrance to a quarrel; but being in, Bearâ€™t thatthâ€™opposed may beware of thee. Give every man thine ear, but few thyvoice: Take each manâ€™s censure, but reserve thy judgment. Costly thyhabit as thy purse can buy, But not expressâ€™d in fancy; rich, notgaudy: For the apparel oft proclaims the man; And they in France of thebest rank and station Are of a most select and generous chief in that.Neither a borrower nor a lender be: For loan oft loses both itself andfriend; And borrowing dulls the edge of husbandry. This above all: tothine own self be true; And it must follow, as the night the day, Thoucanst not then be false to any man. Farewell: my blessing season thisin thee.LAERTES. Most humbly do I take my leave, my lord.POLONIUS. The time invites you; go, your servants tend.LAERTES. Farewell, Ophelia, and remember well What I have said to you.OPHELIA. â€™Tis in my memory lockâ€™d, And you yourself shall keep the keyof it.LAERTES. Farewell. [_Exit._]POLONIUS. What isâ€™t, Ophelia, he hath said to you?OPHELIA. So please you, something touching the Lord Hamlet.POLONIUS. Marry, well bethought: â€™Tis told me he hath very oft of lateGiven private time to you; and you yourself Have of your audience beenmost free and bounteous. If it be so,â€”as so â€™tis put on me, And that inway of caution,â€”I must tell you You do not understand yourself soclearly As it behoves my daughter and your honour. What is between you?Give me up the truth.OPHELIA. He hath, my lord, of late made many tenders Of his affectionto me.POLONIUS. Affection! Pooh! You speak like a green girl, Unsifted insuch perilous circumstance. Do you believe his tenders, as you callthem?OPHELIA. I do not know, my lord, what I should think.POLONIUS. Marry, Iâ€™ll teach you; think yourself a baby; That you havetaâ€™en these tenders for true pay, Which are not sterling. Tenderyourself more dearly; Or,â€”not to crack the wind of the poor phrase,Roaming it thus,â€”youâ€™ll tender me a fool.OPHELIA. My lord, he hath importunâ€™d me with love In honourablefashion.POLONIUS. Ay, fashion you may call it; go to, go to.OPHELIA. And hath given countenance to his speech, my lord, With almostall the holy vows of heaven.POLONIUS. Ay, springes to catch woodcocks. I do know, When the bloodburns, how prodigal the soul Lends the tongue vows: these blazes,daughter, Giving more light than heat, extinct in both, Even in theirpromise, as it is a-making, You must not take for fire. From this timeBe something scanter of your maiden presence; Set your entreatments ata higher rate Than a command to parley. For Lord Hamlet, Believe somuch in him that he is young; And with a larger tether may he walk Thanmay be given you. In few, Ophelia, Do not believe his vows; for theyare brokers, Not of that dye which their investments show, But mereimplorators of unholy suits, Breathing like sanctified and pious bawds,The better to beguile. This is for all. I would not, in plain terms,from this time forth Have you so slander any moment leisure As to givewords or talk with the Lord Hamlet. Look toâ€™t, I charge you; come yourways.OPHELIA. I shall obey, my lord. [_Exeunt._]SCENE IV. The platform. Enter Hamlet, Horatio and Marcellus.HAMLET. The air bites shrewdly; it is very cold.HORATIO. It is a nipping and an eager air.HAMLET. What hour now?HORATIO. I think it lacks of twelve.MARCELLUS. No, it is struck.HORATIO. Indeed? I heard it not. It then draws near the season Whereinthe spirit held his wont to walk. [_A flourish of trumpets, and ordnance shot off within._]What does this mean, my lord?HAMLET. The King doth wake tonight and takes his rouse, Keeps wassail,and the swaggering upspring reels; And as he drains his draughts ofRhenish down, The kettle-drum and trumpet thus bray out The triumph ofhis pledge.HORATIO. Is it a custom?HAMLET. Ay marry isâ€™t; And to my mind, though I am native here, And tothe manner born, it is a custom More honourâ€™d in the breach than theobservance. This heavy-headed revel east and west Makes us traducâ€™d andtaxâ€™d of other nations: They clepe us drunkards, and with swinishphrase Soil our addition; and indeed it takes From our achievements,though performâ€™d at height, The pith and marrow of our attribute. Sooft it chances in particular men That for some vicious mole of naturein them, As in their birth, wherein they are not guilty, Since naturecannot choose his origin, By their oâ€™ergrowth of some complexion, Oftbreaking down the pales and forts of reason; Or by some habit, that toomuch oâ€™erleavens The form of plausive manners;â€”that these men,Carrying, I say, the stamp of one defect, Being Natureâ€™s livery orFortuneâ€™s star,â€” His virtues else,â€”be they as pure as grace, Asinfinite as man may undergo, Shall in the general censure takecorruption From that particular fault. The dram of evil Doth all thenoble substance often doubt To his own scandal.HORATIO. Look, my lord, it comes! Enter Ghost.HAMLET. Angels and ministers of grace defend us! Be thou a spirit ofhealth or goblin damnâ€™d, Bring with thee airs from heaven or blastsfrom hell, Be thy intents wicked or charitable, Thou comâ€™st in such aquestionable shape That I will speak to thee. Iâ€™ll call thee Hamlet,King, father, royal Dane. O, answer me! Let me not burst in ignorance;but tell Why thy canonizâ€™d bones, hearsed in death, Have burst theircerements; why the sepulchre, Wherein we saw thee quietly inurnâ€™d, Hathopâ€™d his ponderous and marble jaws To cast thee up again! What may thismean, That thou, dead corse, again in complete steel, Revisitâ€™st thusthe glimpses of the moon, Making night hideous, and we fools of natureSo horridly to shake our disposition With thoughts beyond the reachesof our souls? Say, why is this? Wherefore? What should we do? [_Ghost beckons Hamlet._]HORATIO. It beckons you to go away with it, As if it some impartmentdid desire To you alone.MARCELLUS. Look with what courteous action It waves you to a moreremoved ground. But do not go with it.HORATIO. No, by no means.HAMLET. It will not speak; then will I follow it.HORATIO. Do not, my lord.HAMLET. Why, what should be the fear? I do not set my life at a pinâ€™sfee; And for my soul, what can it do to that, Being a thing immortal asitself? It waves me forth again. Iâ€™ll follow it.HORATIO. What if it tempt you toward the flood, my lord, Or to thedreadful summit of the cliff That beetles oâ€™er his base into the sea,And there assume some other horrible form Which might deprive yoursovereignty of reason, And draw you into madness? Think of it. The veryplace puts toys of desperation, Without more motive, into every brainThat looks so many fadoms to the sea And hears it roar beneath.HAMLET. It waves me still. Go on, Iâ€™ll follow thee.MARCELLUS. You shall not go, my lord.HAMLET. Hold off your hands.HORATIO. Be rulâ€™d; you shall not go.HAMLET. My fate cries out, And makes each petty artery in this body Ashardy as the Nemean lionâ€™s nerve. [_Ghost beckons._]Still am I callâ€™d. Unhand me, gentlemen. [_Breaking free from them._]By heaven, Iâ€™ll make a ghost of him that lets me. I say, away!â€”Go on,Iâ€™ll follow thee. [_Exeunt Ghost and Hamlet._]HORATIO. He waxes desperate with imagination.MARCELLUS. Letâ€™s follow; â€™tis not fit thus to obey him.HORATIO. Have after. To what issue will this come?MARCELLUS. Something is rotten in the state of Denmark.HORATIO. Heaven will direct it.MARCELLUS. Nay, letâ€™s follow him. [_Exeunt._]SCENE V. A more remote part of the Castle. Enter Ghost and Hamlet.HAMLET. Whither wilt thou lead me? Speak, Iâ€™ll go no further.GHOST. Mark me.HAMLET. I will.GHOST. My hour is almost come, When I to sulphâ€™rous and tormentingflames Must render up myself.HAMLET. Alas, poor ghost!GHOST. Pity me not, but lend thy serious hearing To what I shallunfold.HAMLET. Speak, I am bound to hear.GHOST. So art thou to revenge, when thou shalt hear.HAMLET. What?GHOST. I am thy fatherâ€™s spirit, Doomâ€™d for a certain term to walk thenight, And for the day confinâ€™d to fast in fires, Till the foul crimesdone in my days of nature Are burnt and purgâ€™d away. But that I amforbid To tell the secrets of my prison-house, I could a tale unfoldwhose lightest word Would harrow up thy soul; freeze thy young blood,Make thy two eyes like stars start from their spheres, Thy knotted andcombined locks to part, And each particular hair to stand on end Likequills upon the fretful porcupine. But this eternal blazon must not beTo ears of flesh and blood. List, list, O, list! If thou didst ever thydear father loveâ€”HAMLET. O God!GHOST. Revenge his foul and most unnatural murder.HAMLET. Murder!GHOST. Murder most foul, as in the best it is; But this most foul,strange, and unnatural.HAMLET. Haste me to knowâ€™t, that I, with wings as swift As meditationor the thoughts of love May sweep to my revenge.GHOST. I find thee apt; And duller shouldst thou be than the fat weedThat rots itself in ease on Lethe wharf, Wouldst thou not stir in this.Now, Hamlet, hear. â€™Tis given out that, sleeping in my orchard, Aserpent stung me; so the whole ear of Denmark Is by a forged process ofmy death Rankly abusâ€™d; but know, thou noble youth, The serpent thatdid sting thy fatherâ€™s life Now wears his crown.HAMLET. O my prophetic soul! Mine uncle!GHOST. Ay, that incestuous, that adulterate beast, With witchcraft ofhis wit, with traitorous gifts,â€” O wicked wit, and gifts, that have thepower So to seduce!â€”won to his shameful lust The will of my mostseeming-virtuous queen. O Hamlet, what a falling off was there, Fromme, whose love was of that dignity That it went hand in hand even withthe vow I made to her in marriage; and to decline Upon a wretch whosenatural gifts were poor To those of mine. But virtue, as it never willbe movâ€™d, Though lewdness court it in a shape of heaven; So lust,though to a radiant angel linkâ€™d, Will sate itself in a celestial bedAnd prey on garbage. But soft! methinks I scent the morning air; Brieflet me be. Sleeping within my orchard, My custom always of theafternoon, Upon my secure hour thy uncle stole With juice of cursedhebenon in a vial, And in the porches of my ears did pour The leperousdistilment, whose effect Holds such an enmity with blood of man Thatswift as quicksilver it courses through The natural gates and alleys ofthe body; And with a sudden vigour it doth posset And curd, like eagerdroppings into milk, The thin and wholesome blood. So did it mine; Anda most instant tetter barkâ€™d about, Most lazar-like, with vile andloathsome crust All my smooth body. Thus was I, sleeping, by abrotherâ€™s hand, Of life, of crown, of queen at once dispatchâ€™d: Cut offeven in the blossoms of my sin, Unhousâ€™led, disappointed, unanelâ€™d; Noreckoning made, but sent to my account With all my imperfections on myhead. O horrible! O horrible! most horrible! If thou hast nature inthee, bear it not; Let not the royal bed of Denmark be A couch forluxury and damned incest. But howsoever thou pursuâ€™st this act, Taintnot thy mind, nor let thy soul contrive Against thy mother aught; leaveher to heaven, And to those thorns that in her bosom lodge, To prickand sting her. Fare thee well at once! The glow-worm shows the matin tobe near, And â€™gins to pale his uneffectual fire. Adieu, adieu, adieu.Hamlet, remember me. [_Exit._]HAMLET. O all you host of heaven! O earth! What else? And shall Icouple hell? O, fie! Hold, my heart; And you, my sinews, grow notinstant old, But bear me stiffly up. Remember thee? Ay, thou poorghost, while memory holds a seat In this distracted globe. Rememberthee? Yea, from the table of my memory Iâ€™ll wipe away all trivial fondrecords, All saws of books, all forms, all pressures past, That youthand observation copied there; And thy commandment all alone shall liveWithin the book and volume of my brain, Unmixâ€™d with baser matter. Yes,by heaven! O most pernicious woman! O villain, villain, smiling damnedvillain! My tables. Meet it is I set it down, That one may smile, andsmile, and be a villain! At least I am sure it may be so in Denmark. [_Writing._]So, uncle, there you are. Now to my word; It is â€˜Adieu, adieu, rememberme.â€™ I have swornâ€™t.HORATIO and MARCELLUS. [_Within._] My lord, my lord.MARCELLUS. [_Within._] Lord Hamlet.HORATIO. [_Within._] Heaven secure him.HAMLET. So be it!MARCELLUS. [_Within._] Illo, ho, ho, my lord!HAMLET. Hillo, ho, ho, boy! Come, bird, come. Enter Horatio and Marcellus.MARCELLUS. How isâ€™t, my noble lord?HORATIO. What news, my lord?HAMLET. O, wonderful!HORATIO. Good my lord, tell it.HAMLET. No, youâ€™ll reveal it.HORATIO. Not I, my lord, by heaven.MARCELLUS. Nor I, my lord.HAMLET. How say you then, would heart of man once think it?â€” But youâ€™llbe secret?HORATIO and MARCELLUS. Ay, by heaven, my lord.HAMLET. Thereâ€™s neâ€™er a villain dwelling in all Denmark But heâ€™s anarrant knave.HORATIO. There needs no ghost, my lord, come from the grave To tell usthis.HAMLET. Why, right; you are iâ€™ the right; And so, without morecircumstance at all, I hold it fit that we shake hands and part: You,as your business and desires shall point you,â€” For every man hathbusiness and desire, Such as it is;â€”and for my own poor part, Look you,Iâ€™ll go pray.HORATIO. These are but wild and whirling words, my lord.HAMLET. Iâ€™m sorry they offend you, heartily; Yes faith, heartily.HORATIO. Thereâ€™s no offence, my lord.HAMLET. Yes, by Saint Patrick, but there is, Horatio, And much offencetoo. Touching this vision here, It is an honest ghost, that let me tellyou. For your desire to know what is between us, Oâ€™ermasterâ€™t as youmay. And now, good friends, As you are friends, scholars, and soldiers,Give me one poor request.HORATIO. What isâ€™t, my lord? We will.HAMLET. Never make known what you have seen tonight.HORATIO and MARCELLUS. My lord, we will not.HAMLET. Nay, but swearâ€™t.HORATIO. In faith, my lord, not I.MARCELLUS. Nor I, my lord, in faith.HAMLET. Upon my sword.MARCELLUS. We have sworn, my lord, already.HAMLET. Indeed, upon my sword, indeed.GHOST. [_Cries under the stage._] Swear.HAMLET. Ha, ha boy, sayâ€™st thou so? Art thou there, truepenny? Come on,you hear this fellow in the cellarage. Consent to swear.HORATIO. Propose the oath, my lord.HAMLET. Never to speak of this that you have seen. Swear by my sword.GHOST. [_Beneath._] Swear.HAMLET. _Hic et ubique?_ Then weâ€™ll shift our ground. Come hither,gentlemen, And lay your hands again upon my sword. Never to speak ofthis that you have heard. Swear by my sword.GHOST. [_Beneath._] Swear.HAMLET. Well said, old mole! Canst work iâ€™ thâ€™earth so fast? A worthypioner! Once more remove, good friends.HORATIO. O day and night, but this is wondrous strange.HAMLET. And therefore as a stranger give it welcome. There are morethings in heaven and earth, Horatio, Than are dreamt of in yourphilosophy. But come, Here, as before, never, so help you mercy, Howstrange or odd soeâ€™er I bear myself,â€” As I perchance hereafter shallthink meet To put an antic disposition onâ€” That you, at such timesseeing me, never shall, With arms encumberâ€™d thus, or this head-shake,Or by pronouncing of some doubtful phrase, As â€˜Well, we knowâ€™, or â€˜Wecould and if we wouldâ€™, Or â€˜If we list to speakâ€™; or â€˜There be and ifthey mightâ€™, Or such ambiguous giving out, to note That you know aughtof me:â€”this not to do. So grace and mercy at your most need help you,Swear.GHOST. [_Beneath._] Swear.HAMLET. Rest, rest, perturbed spirit. So, gentlemen, With all my love Ido commend me to you; And what so poor a man as Hamlet is May dotâ€™express his love and friending to you, God willing, shall not lack.Let us go in together, And still your fingers on your lips, I pray. Thetime is out of joint. O cursed spite, That ever I was born to set itright. Nay, come, letâ€™s go together. [_Exeunt._]ACT IISCENE I. A room in Poloniusâ€™s house. Enter Polonius and Reynaldo.POLONIUS. Give him this money and these notes, Reynaldo.REYNALDO. I will, my lord.POLONIUS. You shall do marvellous wisely, good Reynaldo, Before youvisit him, to make inquiry Of his behaviour.REYNALDO. My lord, I did intend it.POLONIUS. Marry, well said; very well said. Look you, sir, Enquire mefirst what Danskers are in Paris; And how, and who, what means, andwhere they keep, What company, at what expense; and finding By thisencompassment and drift of question, That they do know my son, come youmore nearer Than your particular demands will touch it. Take you asâ€™twere some distant knowledge of him, As thus, â€˜I know his father andhis friends, And in part himâ€™â€”do you mark this, Reynaldo?REYNALDO. Ay, very well, my lord.POLONIUS. â€˜And in part him, but,â€™ you may say, â€˜not well; But ifâ€™t behe I mean, heâ€™s very wild; Addicted so and so;â€™ and there put on himWhat forgeries you please; marry, none so rank As may dishonour him;take heed of that; But, sir, such wanton, wild, and usual slips As arecompanions noted and most known To youth and liberty.REYNALDO. As gaming, my lord?POLONIUS. Ay, or drinking, fencing, swearing, Quarrelling, drabbing.You may go so far.REYNALDO. My lord, that would dishonour him.POLONIUS. Faith no, as you may season it in the charge. You must notput another scandal on him, That he is open to incontinency; Thatâ€™s notmy meaning: but breathe his faults so quaintly That they may seem thetaints of liberty; The flash and outbreak of a fiery mind, A savagenessin unreclaimed blood, Of general assault.REYNALDO. But my good lordâ€”POLONIUS. Wherefore should you do this?REYNALDO. Ay, my lord, I would know that.POLONIUS. Marry, sir, hereâ€™s my drift, And I believe it is a fetch ofwarrant. You laying these slight sullies on my son, As â€™twere a thing alittle soilâ€™d iâ€™ thâ€™ working, Mark you, Your party in converse, him youwould sound, Having ever seen in the prenominate crimes The youth youbreathe of guilty, be assurâ€™d He closes with you in this consequence;â€˜Good sir,â€™ or so; or â€˜friend,â€™ or â€˜gentlemanâ€™â€” According to the phraseor the addition Of man and country.REYNALDO. Very good, my lord.POLONIUS. And then, sir, does he this,â€” He doesâ€”What was I about tosay? By the mass, I was about to say something. Where did I leave?REYNALDO. At â€˜closes in the consequence.â€™ At â€˜friend or so,â€™ andâ€˜gentleman.â€™POLONIUS. At â€˜closes in the consequenceâ€™ ay, marry! He closes with youthus: â€˜I know the gentleman, I saw him yesterday, or tâ€™other day, Orthen, or then, with such and such; and, as you say, There was hegaming, there oâ€™ertook inâ€™s rouse, There falling out at tennisâ€™: orperchance, â€˜I saw him enter such a house of saleâ€™â€” _Videlicet_, abrothel, or so forth. See you now; Your bait of falsehood takes thiscarp of truth; And thus do we of wisdom and of reach, With windlasses,and with assays of bias, By indirections find directions out. So by myformer lecture and advice Shall you my son. You have me, have you not?REYNALDO. My lord, I have.POLONIUS. God bâ€™ wiâ€™ you, fare you well.REYNALDO. Good my lord.POLONIUS. Observe his inclination in yourself.REYNALDO. I shall, my lord.POLONIUS. And let him ply his music.REYNALDO. Well, my lord.POLONIUS. Farewell. [_Exit Reynaldo._] Enter Ophelia.How now, Ophelia, whatâ€™s the matter?OPHELIA. Alas, my lord, I have been so affrighted.POLONIUS. With what, in the name of God?OPHELIA. My lord, as I was sewing in my chamber, Lord Hamlet, with hisdoublet all unbracâ€™d, No hat upon his head, his stockings foulâ€™d,Ungartâ€™red, and down-gyved to his ankle, Pale as his shirt, his kneesknocking each other, And with a look so piteous in purport As if he hadbeen loosed out of hell To speak of horrors, he comes before me.POLONIUS. Mad for thy love?OPHELIA. My lord, I do not know, but truly I do fear it.POLONIUS. What said he?OPHELIA. He took me by the wrist and held me hard; Then goes he to thelength of all his arm; And with his other hand thus oâ€™er his brow, Hefalls to such perusal of my face As he would draw it. Long stayâ€™d heso, At last,â€”a little shaking of mine arm, And thrice his head thuswaving up and down, He raisâ€™d a sigh so piteous and profound As it didseem to shatter all his bulk And end his being. That done, he lets mego, And with his head over his shoulder turnâ€™d He seemâ€™d to find hisway without his eyes, For out oâ€™ doors he went without their help, Andto the last bended their light on me.POLONIUS. Come, go with me. I will go seek the King. This is the veryecstasy of love, Whose violent property fordoes itself, And leads thewill to desperate undertakings, As oft as any passion under heaven Thatdoes afflict our natures. I am sorry,â€” What, have you given him anyhard words of late?OPHELIA. No, my good lord; but as you did command, I did repel hisletters and denied His access to me.POLONIUS. That hath made him mad. I am sorry that with better heed andjudgment I had not quoted him. I fearâ€™d he did but trifle, And meant towreck thee. But beshrew my jealousy! It seems it is as proper to ourage To cast beyond ourselves in our opinions As it is common for theyounger sort To lack discretion. Come, go we to the King. This must beknown, which, being kept close, might move More grief to hide than hateto utter love. [_Exeunt._]SCENE II. A room in the Castle. Enter King, Queen, Rosencrantz, Guildenstern and Attendants.KING. Welcome, dear Rosencrantz and Guildenstern. Moreover that we muchdid long to see you, The need we have to use you did provoke Our hastysending. Something have you heard Of Hamletâ€™s transformation; so I callit, Since nor thâ€™exterior nor the inward man Resembles that it was.What it should be, More than his fatherâ€™s death, that thus hath put himSo much from thâ€™understanding of himself, I cannot dream of. I entreatyou both That, being of so young days brought up with him, And since soneighbourâ€™d to his youth and humour, That you vouchsafe your rest herein our court Some little time, so by your companies To draw him on topleasures and to gather, So much as from occasion you may glean,Whether aught to us unknown afflicts him thus That, openâ€™d, lies withinour remedy.QUEEN. Good gentlemen, he hath much talkâ€™d of you, And sure I am, twomen there are not living To whom he more adheres. If it will please youTo show us so much gentry and good will As to expend your time with usawhile, For the supply and profit of our hope, Your visitation shallreceive such thanks As fits a kingâ€™s remembrance.ROSENCRANTZ. Both your majesties Might, by the sovereign power you haveof us, Put your dread pleasures more into command Than to entreaty.GUILDENSTERN. We both obey, And here give up ourselves, in the fullbent, To lay our service freely at your feet To be commanded.KING. Thanks, Rosencrantz and gentle Guildenstern.QUEEN. Thanks, Guildenstern and gentle Rosencrantz. And I beseech youinstantly to visit My too much changed son. Go, some of you, And bringthese gentlemen where Hamlet is.GUILDENSTERN. Heavens make our presence and our practices Pleasant andhelpful to him.QUEEN. Ay, amen. [_Exeunt Rosencrantz, Guildenstern and some Attendants._] Enter Polonius.POLONIUS. Thâ€™ambassadors from Norway, my good lord, Are joyfullyreturnâ€™d.KING. Thou still hast been the father of good news.POLONIUS. Have I, my lord? Assure you, my good liege, I hold my duty,as I hold my soul, Both to my God and to my gracious King: And I dothink,â€”or else this brain of mine Hunts not the trail of policy so sureAs it hath usâ€™d to doâ€”that I have found The very cause of Hamletâ€™slunacy.KING. O speak of that, that do I long to hear.POLONIUS. Give first admittance to thâ€™ambassadors; My news shall be thefruit to that great feast.KING. Thyself do grace to them, and bring them in. [_Exit Polonius._]He tells me, my sweet queen, that he hath found The head and source ofall your sonâ€™s distemper.QUEEN. I doubt it is no other but the main, His fatherâ€™s death and ouroâ€™erhasty marriage.KING. Well, we shall sift him. Enter Polonius with Voltemand and Cornelius.Welcome, my good friends! Say, Voltemand, what from our brother Norway?VOLTEMAND. Most fair return of greetings and desires. Upon our first,he sent out to suppress His nephewâ€™s levies, which to him appearâ€™d Tobe a preparation â€™gainst the Polack; But better lookâ€™d into, he trulyfound It was against your Highness; whereat grievâ€™d, That so hissickness, age, and impotence Was falsely borne in hand, sends outarrests On Fortinbras; which he, in brief, obeys, Receives rebuke fromNorway; and in fine, Makes vow before his uncle never more To givethâ€™assay of arms against your Majesty. Whereon old Norway, overcomewith joy, Gives him three thousand crowns in annual fee, And hiscommission to employ those soldiers So levied as before, against thePolack: With an entreaty, herein further shown, [_Gives a paper._] Thatit might please you to give quiet pass Through your dominions for thisenterprise, On such regards of safety and allowance As therein are setdown.KING. It likes us well; And at our more considerâ€™d time weâ€™ll read,Answer, and think upon this business. Meantime we thank you for yourwell-took labour. Go to your rest, at night weâ€™ll feast together:. Mostwelcome home. [_Exeunt Voltemand and Cornelius._]POLONIUS. This business is well ended. My liege and madam, toexpostulate What majesty should be, what duty is, Why day is day, nightnight, and time is time. Were nothing but to waste night, day and time.Therefore, since brevity is the soul of wit, And tediousness the limbsand outward flourishes, I will be brief. Your noble son is mad. Madcall I it; for to define true madness, What isâ€™t but to be nothing elsebut mad? But let that go.QUEEN. More matter, with less art.POLONIUS. Madam, I swear I use no art at all. That he is mad, â€™tistrue: â€™tis true â€™tis pity; And pity â€™tis â€™tis true. A foolish figure,But farewell it, for I will use no art. Mad let us grant him then. Andnow remains That we find out the cause of this effect, Or rather say,the cause of this defect, For this effect defective comes by cause.Thus it remains, and the remainder thus. Perpend, I have adaughterâ€”have whilst she is mineâ€” Who in her duty and obedience, mark,Hath given me this. Now gather, and surmise. [_Reads._] _To thecelestial, and my soulâ€™s idol, the most beautified Ophelia_â€” Thatâ€™s anill phrase, a vile phrase; â€˜beautifiedâ€™ is a vile phrase: but you shallhear. [_Reads._] _these; in her excellent white bosom, these, &amp;c._QUEEN. Came this from Hamlet to her?POLONIUS. Good madam, stay awhile; I will be faithful. [_Reads._]_Doubt thou the stars are fire, Doubt that the sun doth move, Doubttruth to be a liar, But never doubt I love. O dear Ophelia, I am ill atthese numbers. I have not art to reckon my groans. But that I love theebest, O most best, believe it. Adieu. Thine evermore, most dear lady,whilst this machine is to him, HAMLET._ This in obedience hath mydaughter showâ€™d me; And more above, hath his solicitings, As they fellout by time, by means, and place, All given to mine ear.KING. But how hath she receivâ€™d his love?POLONIUS. What do you think of me?KING. As of a man faithful and honourable.POLONIUS. I would fain prove so. But what might you think, When I hadseen this hot love on the wing, As I perceivâ€™d it, I must tell youthat, Before my daughter told me, what might you, Or my dear Majestyyour queen here, think, If I had playâ€™d the desk or table-book, Orgiven my heart a winking, mute and dumb, Or lookâ€™d upon this love withidle sight, What might you think? No, I went round to work, And myyoung mistress thus I did bespeak: â€˜Lord Hamlet is a prince, out of thystar. This must not be.â€™ And then I precepts gave her, That she shouldlock herself from his resort, Admit no messengers, receive no tokens.Which done, she took the fruits of my advice, And he, repulsed,â€”a shorttale to makeâ€” Fell into a sadness, then into a fast, Thence to a watch,thence into a weakness, Thence to a lightness, and, by this declension,Into the madness wherein now he raves, And all we wail for.KING. Do you think â€™tis this?QUEEN. It may be, very likely.POLONIUS. Hath there been such a time, Iâ€™d fain know that, That I havepositively said â€˜â€™Tis so,â€™ When it provâ€™d otherwise?KING. Not that I know.POLONIUS. Take this from this, if this be otherwise. [_Points to hishead and shoulder._] If circumstances lead me, I will find Where truthis hid, though it were hid indeed Within the centre.KING. How may we try it further?POLONIUS. You know sometimes he walks four hours together Here in thelobby.QUEEN. So he does indeed.POLONIUS. At such a time Iâ€™ll loose my daughter to him. Be you and Ibehind an arras then, Mark the encounter. If he love her not, And benot from his reason fallâ€™n thereon, Let me be no assistant for a state,But keep a farm and carters.KING. We will try it. Enter Hamlet, reading.QUEEN. But look where sadly the poor wretch comes reading.POLONIUS. Away, I do beseech you, both away Iâ€™ll board him presently.O, give me leave. [_Exeunt King, Queen and Attendants._]How does my good Lord Hamlet?HAMLET. Well, God-a-mercy.POLONIUS. Do you know me, my lord?HAMLET. Excellent well. Youâ€™re a fishmonger.POLONIUS. Not I, my lord.HAMLET. Then I would you were so honest a man.POLONIUS. Honest, my lord?HAMLET. Ay sir, to be honest, as this world goes, is to be one manpicked out of ten thousand.POLONIUS. Thatâ€™s very true, my lord.HAMLET. For if the sun breed maggots in a dead dog, being a goodkissing carrion,â€” Have you a daughter?POLONIUS. I have, my lord.HAMLET. Let her not walk iâ€™ thâ€™ sun. Conception is a blessing, but notas your daughter may conceive. Friend, look toâ€™t.POLONIUS. How say you by that? [_Aside._] Still harping on my daughter.Yet he knew me not at first; he said I was a fishmonger. He is fargone, far gone. And truly in my youth I suffered much extremity forlove; very near this. Iâ€™ll speak to him again.â€”What do you read, mylord?HAMLET. Words, words, words.POLONIUS. What is the matter, my lord?HAMLET. Between who?POLONIUS. I mean the matter that you read, my lord.HAMLET. Slanders, sir. For the satirical slave says here that old menhave grey beards; that their faces are wrinkled; their eyes purgingthick amber and plum-tree gum; and that they have a plentiful lack ofwit, together with most weak hams. All which, sir, though I mostpowerfully and potently believe, yet I hold it not honesty to have itthus set down. For you yourself, sir, should be old as I am, if like acrab you could go backward.POLONIUS. [_Aside._] Though this be madness, yet there is a methodinâ€™t.â€” Will you walk out of the air, my lord?HAMLET. Into my grave?POLONIUS. Indeed, that is out oâ€™ the air. [_Aside._] How pregnantsometimes his replies are! A happiness that often madness hits on,which reason and sanity could not so prosperously be delivered of. Iwill leave him and suddenly contrive the means of meeting between himand my daughter. My honourable lord, I will most humbly take my leaveof you.HAMLET. You cannot, sir, take from me anything that I will morewillingly part withal, except my life, except my life, except my life.POLONIUS. Fare you well, my lord.HAMLET. These tedious old fools. Enter Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.POLONIUS. You go to seek the Lord Hamlet; there he is.ROSENCRANTZ. [_To Polonius._] God save you, sir. [_Exit Polonius._]GUILDENSTERN. My honoured lord!ROSENCRANTZ. My most dear lord!HAMLET. My excellent good friends! How dost thou, Guildenstern? Ah,Rosencrantz. Good lads, how do ye both?ROSENCRANTZ. As the indifferent children of the earth.GUILDENSTERN. Happy in that we are not over-happy; On Fortuneâ€™s cap weare not the very button.HAMLET. Nor the soles of her shoe?ROSENCRANTZ. Neither, my lord.HAMLET. Then you live about her waist, or in the middle of her favours?GUILDENSTERN. Faith, her privates we.HAMLET. In the secret parts of Fortune? O, most true; she is astrumpet. Whatâ€™s the news?ROSENCRANTZ. None, my lord, but that the worldâ€™s grown honest.HAMLET. Then is doomsday near. But your news is not true. Let mequestion more in particular. What have you, my good friends, deservedat the hands of Fortune, that she sends you to prison hither?GUILDENSTERN. Prison, my lord?HAMLET. Denmarkâ€™s a prison.ROSENCRANTZ. Then is the world one.HAMLET. A goodly one; in which there are many confines, wards, anddungeons, Denmark being one oâ€™ thâ€™ worst.ROSENCRANTZ. We think not so, my lord.HAMLET. Why, then â€™tis none to you; for there is nothing either good orbad but thinking makes it so. To me it is a prison.ROSENCRANTZ. Why, then your ambition makes it one; â€™tis too narrow foryour mind.HAMLET. O God, I could be bounded in a nutshell, and count myself aking of infinite space, were it not that I have bad dreams.GUILDENSTERN. Which dreams, indeed, are ambition; for the verysubstance of the ambitious is merely the shadow of a dream.HAMLET. A dream itself is but a shadow.ROSENCRANTZ. Truly, and I hold ambition of so airy and light a qualitythat it is but a shadowâ€™s shadow.HAMLET. Then are our beggars bodies, and our monarchs and outstretchâ€™dheroes the beggarsâ€™ shadows. Shall we to thâ€™ court? For, by my fay, Icannot reason.ROSENCRANTZ and GUILDENSTERN. Weâ€™ll wait upon you.HAMLET. No such matter. I will not sort you with the rest of myservants; for, to speak to you like an honest man, I am most dreadfullyattended. But, in the beaten way of friendship, what make you atElsinore?ROSENCRANTZ. To visit you, my lord, no other occasion.HAMLET. Beggar that I am, I am even poor in thanks; but I thank you.And sure, dear friends, my thanks are too dear a halfpenny. Were younot sent for? Is it your own inclining? Is it a free visitation? Come,deal justly with me. Come, come; nay, speak.GUILDENSTERN. What should we say, my lord?HAMLET. Why, anything. But to the purpose. You were sent for; and thereis a kind of confession in your looks, which your modesties have notcraft enough to colour. I know the good King and Queen have sent foryou.ROSENCRANTZ. To what end, my lord?HAMLET. That you must teach me. But let me conjure you, by the rightsof our fellowship, by the consonancy of our youth, by the obligation ofour ever-preserved love, and by what more dear a better proposer couldcharge you withal, be even and direct with me, whether you were sentfor or no.ROSENCRANTZ. [_To Guildenstern._] What say you?HAMLET. [_Aside._] Nay, then I have an eye of you. If you love me, holdnot off.GUILDENSTERN. My lord, we were sent for.HAMLET. I will tell you why; so shall my anticipation prevent yourdiscovery, and your secrecy to the King and Queen moult no feather. Ihave of late, but wherefore I know not, lost all my mirth, forgone allcustom of exercises; and indeed, it goes so heavily with my dispositionthat this goodly frame the earth, seems to me a sterile promontory;this most excellent canopy the air, look you, this brave oâ€™erhangingfirmament, this majestical roof fretted with golden fire, why, itappears no other thing to me than a foul and pestilent congregation ofvapours. What a piece of work is man! How noble in reason? How infinitein faculties, in form and moving, how express and admirable? In actionhow like an angel? In apprehension, how like a god? The beauty of theworld, the paragon of animals. And yet, to me, what is thisquintessence of dust? Man delights not me; no, nor woman neither,though by your smiling you seem to say so.ROSENCRANTZ. My lord, there was no such stuff in my thoughts.HAMLET. Why did you laugh then, when I said â€˜Man delights not meâ€™?ROSENCRANTZ. To think, my lord, if you delight not in man, what Lentenentertainment the players shall receive from you. We coted them on theway, and hither are they coming to offer you service.HAMLET. He that plays the king shall be welcome,â€”his Majesty shall havetribute of me; the adventurous knight shall use his foil and target;the lover shall not sigh gratis, the humorous man shall end his part inpeace; the clown shall make those laugh whose lungs are tickle aâ€™ thâ€™sere; and the lady shall say her mind freely, or the blank verse shallhalt forâ€™t. What players are they?ROSENCRANTZ. Even those you were wont to take such delight inâ€”thetragedians of the city.HAMLET. How chances it they travel? Their residence, both in reputationand profit, was better both ways.ROSENCRANTZ. I think their inhibition comes by the means of the lateinnovation.HAMLET. Do they hold the same estimation they did when I was in thecity? Are they so followed?ROSENCRANTZ. No, indeed, they are not.HAMLET. How comes it? Do they grow rusty?ROSENCRANTZ. Nay, their endeavour keeps in the wonted pace; but thereis, sir, an ayry of children, little eyases, that cry out on the top ofquestion, and are most tyrannically clapped forâ€™t. These are now thefashion, and so berattle the common stagesâ€”so they call themâ€”that manywearing rapiers are afraid of goose-quills and dare scarce comethither.HAMLET. What, are they children? Who maintains â€™em? How are theyescoted? Will they pursue the quality no longer than they can sing?Will they not say afterwards, if they should grow themselves to commonplayersâ€”as it is most like, if their means are no betterâ€”their writersdo them wrong to make them exclaim against their own succession?ROSENCRANTZ. Faith, there has been much to do on both sides; and thenation holds it no sin to tarre them to controversy. There was for awhile, no money bid for argument unless the poet and the player went tocuffs in the question.HAMLET. Isâ€™t possible?GUILDENSTERN. O, there has been much throwing about of brains.HAMLET. Do the boys carry it away?ROSENCRANTZ. Ay, that they do, my lord. Hercules and his load too.HAMLET. It is not very strange; for my uncle is King of Denmark, andthose that would make mouths at him while my father lived, give twenty,forty, fifty, a hundred ducats apiece for his picture in little.â€™Sblood, there is something in this more than natural, if philosophycould find it out. [_Flourish of trumpets within._]GUILDENSTERN. There are the players.HAMLET. Gentlemen, you are welcome to Elsinore. Your hands, come. Theappurtenance of welcome is fashion and ceremony. Let me comply with youin this garb, lest my extent to the players, which I tell you must showfairly outward, should more appear like entertainment than yours. Youare welcome. But my uncle-father and aunt-mother are deceived.GUILDENSTERN. In what, my dear lord?HAMLET. I am but mad north-north-west. When the wind is southerly, Iknow a hawk from a handsaw. Enter Polonius.POLONIUS. Well be with you, gentlemen.HAMLET. Hark you, Guildenstern, and you too, at each ear a hearer. Thatgreat baby you see there is not yet out of his swaddling clouts.ROSENCRANTZ. Happily heâ€™s the second time come to them; for they say anold man is twice a child.HAMLET. I will prophesy he comes to tell me of the players. Markit.â€”You say right, sir: for a Monday morning â€™twas so indeed.POLONIUS. My lord, I have news to tell you.HAMLET. My lord, I have news to tell you. When Roscius was an actor inRomeâ€”POLONIUS. The actors are come hither, my lord.HAMLET. Buzz, buzz.POLONIUS. Upon my honour.HAMLET. Then came each actor on his assâ€”POLONIUS. The best actors in the world, either for tragedy, comedy,history, pastoral, pastoral-comical, historical-pastoral,tragical-historical, tragical-comical-historical-pastoral, sceneindividable, or poem unlimited. Seneca cannot be too heavy, nor Plautustoo light, for the law of writ and the liberty. These are the only men.HAMLET. O Jephthah, judge of Israel, what a treasure hadst thou!POLONIUS. What treasure had he, my lord?HAMLET. Whyâ€” â€™One fair daughter, and no more, The which he lovedpassing well.â€™POLONIUS. [_Aside._] Still on my daughter.HAMLET. Am I not iâ€™ thâ€™ right, old Jephthah?POLONIUS. If you call me Jephthah, my lord, I have a daughter that Ilove passing well.HAMLET. Nay, that follows not.POLONIUS. What follows then, my lord?HAMLET. Why, As by lot, God wot, and then, you know, It came to pass,as most like it was. The first row of the pious chanson will show youmore. For look where my abridgement comes. Enter four or five Players.You are welcome, masters, welcome all. I am glad to see thee well.Welcome, good friends. O, my old friend! Thy face is valancâ€™d since Isaw thee last. Comâ€™st thou to beard me in Denmark? What, my young ladyand mistress! Byâ€™r lady, your ladyship is nearer to heaven than when Isaw you last, by the altitude of a chopine. Pray God your voice, like apiece of uncurrent gold, be not cracked within the ring. Masters, youare all welcome. Weâ€™ll eâ€™en toâ€™t like French falconers, fly at anythingwe see. Weâ€™ll have a speech straight. Come, give us a taste of yourquality. Come, a passionate speech.FIRST PLAYER. What speech, my lord?HAMLET. I heard thee speak me a speech once, but it was never acted, orif it was, not above once, for the play, I remember, pleased not themillion, â€™twas caviare to the general. But it wasâ€”as I received it, andothers, whose judgments in such matters cried in the top of mineâ€”anexcellent play, well digested in the scenes, set down with as muchmodesty as cunning. I remember one said there were no sallets in thelines to make the matter savoury, nor no matter in the phrase thatmight indite the author of affectation, but called it an honest method,as wholesome as sweet, and by very much more handsome than fine. Onespeech in it, I chiefly loved. â€™Twas Aeneasâ€™ tale to Dido, andthereabout of it especially where he speaks of Priamâ€™s slaughter. If itlive in your memory, begin at this line, let me see, let me see: _Therugged Pyrrhus, like thâ€™ Hyrcanian beast,â€”_ It is not so: it beginswith Pyrrhusâ€” _The rugged Pyrrhus, he whose sable arms, Black as hispurpose, did the night resemble When he lay couched in the ominoushorse, Hath now this dread and black complexion smearâ€™d With heraldrymore dismal. Head to foot Now is he total gules, horridly trickâ€™d Withblood of fathers, mothers, daughters, sons, Bakâ€™d and impasted with theparching streets, That lend a tyrannous and a damned light To theirvile murders. Roasted in wrath and fire, And thus oâ€™ersized withcoagulate gore, With eyes like carbuncles, the hellish Pyrrhus Oldgrandsire Priam seeks._ So, proceed you.POLONIUS. â€™Fore God, my lord, well spoken, with good accent and gooddiscretion.FIRST PLAYER. _Anon he finds him, Striking too short at Greeks. Hisantique sword, Rebellious to his arm, lies where it falls, Repugnant tocommand. Unequal matchâ€™d, Pyrrhus at Priam drives, in rage strikeswide; But with the whiff and wind of his fell sword Thâ€™unnerved fatherfalls. Then senseless Ilium, Seeming to feel this blow, with flamingtop Stoops to his base, and with a hideous crash Takes prisonerPyrrhusâ€™ ear. For lo, his sword, Which was declining on the milky headOf reverend Priam, seemâ€™d iâ€™ thâ€™air to stick. So, as a painted tyrant,Pyrrhus stood, And like a neutral to his will and matter, Did nothing.But as we often see against some storm, A silence in the heavens, therack stand still, The bold winds speechless, and the orb below As hushas death, anon the dreadful thunder Doth rend the region; so afterPyrrhusâ€™ pause, Aroused vengeance sets him new a-work, And never didthe Cyclopsâ€™ hammers fall On Marsâ€™s armour, forgâ€™d for proof eterne,With less remorse than Pyrrhusâ€™ bleeding sword Now falls on Priam. Out,out, thou strumpet Fortune! All you gods, In general synod, take awayher power; Break all the spokes and fellies from her wheel, And bowlthe round nave down the hill of heaven, As low as to the fiends._POLONIUS. This is too long.HAMLET. It shall to the barberâ€™s, with your beard.â€”Prythee say on. Heâ€™sfor a jig or a tale of bawdry, or he sleeps. Say on; come to Hecuba.FIRST PLAYER. _But who, O who, had seen the mobled queen,â€”_HAMLET. â€˜The mobled queenâ€™?POLONIUS. Thatâ€™s good! â€˜Mobled queenâ€™ is good.FIRST PLAYER. _Run barefoot up and down, threatâ€™ning the flames Withbisson rheum. A clout upon that head Where late the diadem stood, andfor a robe, About her lank and all oâ€™erteemed loins, A blanket, inthâ€™alarm of fear caught upâ€” Who this had seen, with tongue in venomsteepâ€™d, â€™Gainst Fortuneâ€™s state would treason have pronouncâ€™d. But ifthe gods themselves did see her then, When she saw Pyrrhus makemalicious sport In mincing with his sword her husbandâ€™s limbs, Theinstant burst of clamour that she made,â€” Unless things mortal move themnot at all,â€” Would have made milch the burning eyes of heaven, Andpassion in the gods._POLONIUS. Look, where he has not turnâ€™d his colour, and has tears inâ€™seyes. Pray you, no more.HAMLET. â€™Tis well. Iâ€™ll have thee speak out the rest of this soon.â€”Goodmy lord, will you see the players well bestowed? Do you hear, let thembe well used; for they are the abstracts and brief chronicles of thetime. After your death you were better have a bad epitaph than theirill report while you live.POLONIUS. My lord, I will use them according to their desert.HAMLET. Godâ€™s bodikin, man, better. Use every man after his desert, andwho should scape whipping? Use them after your own honour and dignity.The less they deserve, the more merit is in your bounty. Take them in.POLONIUS. Come, sirs.HAMLET. Follow him, friends. Weâ€™ll hear a play tomorrow. [_Exeunt Polonius with all the Players but the First._]Dost thou hear me, old friend? Can you play _The Murder of Gonzago_?FIRST PLAYER. Ay, my lord.HAMLET. Weâ€™ll haâ€™t tomorrow night. You could for a need study a speechof some dozen or sixteen lines, which I would set down and insert inâ€™t,could you not?FIRST PLAYER. Ay, my lord.HAMLET. Very well. Follow that lord, and look you mock him not. [_Exit First Player._][_To Rosencrantz and Guildenstern_] My good friends, Iâ€™ll leave youtill night. You are welcome to Elsinore.ROSENCRANTZ. Good my lord. [_Exeunt Rosencrantz and Guildenstern._]HAMLET. Ay, so, God bâ€™ wiâ€™ ye. Now I am alone. O what a rogue andpeasant slave am I! Is it not monstrous that this player here, But in afiction, in a dream of passion, Could force his soul so to his ownconceit That from her working all his visage wanâ€™d; Tears in his eyes,distraction inâ€™s aspect, A broken voice, and his whole function suitingWith forms to his conceit? And all for nothing! For Hecuba? Whatâ€™sHecuba to him, or he to Hecuba, That he should weep for her? What wouldhe do, Had he the motive and the cue for passion That I have? He woulddrown the stage with tears And cleave the general ear with horridspeech; Make mad the guilty, and appal the free, Confound the ignorant,and amaze indeed, The very faculties of eyes and ears. Yet I, A dulland muddy-mettled rascal, peak Like John-a-dreams, unpregnant of mycause, And can say nothing. No, not for a king Upon whose property andmost dear life A damnâ€™d defeat was made. Am I a coward? Who calls mevillain, breaks my pate across? Plucks off my beard and blows it in myface? Tweaks me by the nose, gives me the lie iâ€™ thâ€™ throat As deep asto the lungs? Who does me this? Ha! â€™Swounds, I should take it: for itcannot be But I am pigeon-liverâ€™d, and lack gall To make oppressionbitter, or ere this I should have fatted all the region kites With thisslaveâ€™s offal. Bloody, bawdy villain! Remorseless, treacherous,lecherous, kindless villain! Oh vengeance! Why, what an ass am I! Thisis most brave, That I, the son of a dear father murderâ€™d, Prompted tomy revenge by heaven and hell, Must, like a whore, unpack my heart withwords And fall a-cursing like a very drab, A scullion! Fie uponâ€™t! Foh!About, my brain! I have heard That guilty creatures sitting at a play,Have by the very cunning of the scene, Been struck so to the soul thatpresently They have proclaimâ€™d their malefactions. For murder, thoughit have no tongue, will speak With most miraculous organ. Iâ€™ll havethese players Play something like the murder of my father Before mineuncle. Iâ€™ll observe his looks; Iâ€™ll tent him to the quick. If he butblench, I know my course. The spirit that I have seen May be the devil,and the devil hath power Tâ€™assume a pleasing shape, yea, and perhapsOut of my weakness and my melancholy, As he is very potent with suchspirits, Abuses me to damn me. Iâ€™ll have grounds More relative thanthis. The playâ€™s the thing Wherein Iâ€™ll catch the conscience of theKing. [_Exit._]ACT IIISCENE I. A room in the Castle. Enter King, Queen, Polonius, Ophelia, Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.KING. And can you by no drift of circumstance Get from him why he putson this confusion, Grating so harshly all his days of quiet Withturbulent and dangerous lunacy?ROSENCRANTZ. He does confess he feels himself distracted, But from whatcause he will by no means speak.GUILDENSTERN. Nor do we find him forward to be sounded, But with acrafty madness keeps aloof When we would bring him on to someconfession Of his true state.QUEEN. Did he receive you well?ROSENCRANTZ. Most like a gentleman.GUILDENSTERN. But with much forcing of his disposition.ROSENCRANTZ. Niggard of question, but of our demands, Most free in hisreply.QUEEN. Did you assay him to any pastime?ROSENCRANTZ. Madam, it so fell out that certain players We oâ€™er-raughton the way. Of these we told him, And there did seem in him a kind ofjoy To hear of it. They are about the court, And, as I think, they havealready order This night to play before him.POLONIUS. â€™Tis most true; And he beseechâ€™d me to entreat your MajestiesTo hear and see the matter.KING. With all my heart; and it doth much content me To hear him soinclinâ€™d. Good gentlemen, give him a further edge, And drive hispurpose on to these delights.ROSENCRANTZ. We shall, my lord. [_Exeunt Rosencrantz and Guildenstern._]KING. Sweet Gertrude, leave us too, For we have closely sent for Hamlethither, That he, as â€™twere by accident, may here Affront Ophelia. Herfather and myself, lawful espials, Will so bestow ourselves that,seeing unseen, We may of their encounter frankly judge, And gather byhim, as he is behavâ€™d, Ifâ€™t be thâ€™affliction of his love or no Thatthus he suffers for.QUEEN. I shall obey you. And for your part, Ophelia, I do wish Thatyour good beauties be the happy cause Of Hamletâ€™s wildness: so shall Ihope your virtues Will bring him to his wonted way again, To both yourhonours.OPHELIA. Madam, I wish it may. [_Exit Queen._]POLONIUS. Ophelia, walk you here.â€”Gracious, so please you, We willbestow ourselves.â€”[_To Ophelia._] Read on this book, That show of suchan exercise may colour Your loneliness.â€”We are oft to blame in this,â€™Tis too much provâ€™d, that with devotionâ€™s visage And pious action wedo sugar oâ€™er The devil himself.KING. [_Aside._] O â€™tis too true! How smart a lash that speech dothgive my conscience! The harlotâ€™s cheek, beautied with plastering art,Is not more ugly to the thing that helps it Than is my deed to my mostpainted word. O heavy burden!POLONIUS. I hear him coming. Letâ€™s withdraw, my lord. [_Exeunt King and Polonius._] Enter Hamlet.HAMLET. To be, or not to be, that is the question: Whether â€™tis noblerin the mind to suffer The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune, Orto take arms against a sea of troubles, And by opposing end them? Todieâ€”to sleep, No more; and by a sleep to say we end The heart-ache, andthe thousand natural shocks That flesh is heir to: â€™tis a consummationDevoutly to be wishâ€™d. To die, to sleep. To sleep, perchance todreamâ€”ay, thereâ€™s the rub, For in that sleep of death what dreams maycome, When we have shuffled off this mortal coil, Must give us pause.Thereâ€™s the respect That makes calamity of so long life. For who wouldbear the whips and scorns of time, The oppressorâ€™s wrong, the proudmanâ€™s contumely, The pangs of disprizâ€™d love, the lawâ€™s delay, Theinsolence of office, and the spurns That patient merit of the unworthytakes, When he himself might his quietus make With a bare bodkin? Whowould these fardels bear, To grunt and sweat under a weary life, Butthat the dread of something after death, The undiscoverâ€™d country, fromwhose bourn No traveller returns, puzzles the will, And makes us ratherbear those ills we have Than fly to others that we know not of? Thusconscience does make cowards of us all, And thus the native hue ofresolution Is sicklied oâ€™er with the pale cast of thought, Andenterprises of great pith and moment, With this regard their currentsturn awry And lose the name of action. Soft you now, The fair Ophelia!Nymph, in thy orisons Be all my sins rememberâ€™d.OPHELIA. Good my lord, How does your honour for this many a day?HAMLET. I humbly thank you; well, well, well.OPHELIA. My lord, I have remembrances of yours That I have longed longto re-deliver. I pray you, now receive them.HAMLET. No, not I. I never gave you aught.OPHELIA. My honourâ€™d lord, you know right well you did, And with themwords of so sweet breath composâ€™d As made the things more rich; theirperfume lost, Take these again; for to the noble mind Rich gifts waxpoor when givers prove unkind. There, my lord.HAMLET. Ha, ha! Are you honest?OPHELIA. My lord?HAMLET. Are you fair?OPHELIA. What means your lordship?HAMLET. That if you be honest and fair, your honesty should admit nodiscourse to your beauty.OPHELIA. Could beauty, my lord, have better commerce than with honesty?HAMLET. Ay, truly; for the power of beauty will sooner transformhonesty from what it is to a bawd than the force of honesty cantranslate beauty into his likeness. This was sometime a paradox, butnow the time gives it proof. I did love you once.OPHELIA. Indeed, my lord, you made me believe so.HAMLET. You should not have believed me; for virtue cannot so inoculateour old stock but we shall relish of it. I loved you not.OPHELIA. I was the more deceived.HAMLET. Get thee to a nunnery. Why wouldst thou be a breeder ofsinners? I am myself indifferent honest; but yet I could accuse me ofsuch things that it were better my mother had not borne me. I am veryproud, revengeful, ambitious, with more offences at my beck than I havethoughts to put them in, imagination to give them shape, or time to actthem in. What should such fellows as I do crawling between earth andheaven? We are arrant knaves all, believe none of us. Go thy ways to anunnery. Whereâ€™s your father?OPHELIA. At home, my lord.HAMLET. Let the doors be shut upon him, that he may play the foolnowhere but inâ€™s own house. Farewell.OPHELIA. O help him, you sweet heavens!HAMLET. If thou dost marry, Iâ€™ll give thee this plague for thy dowry.Be thou as chaste as ice, as pure as snow, thou shalt not escapecalumny. Get thee to a nunnery, go: farewell. Or if thou wilt needsmarry, marry a fool; for wise men know well enough what monsters youmake of them. To a nunnery, go; and quickly too. Farewell.OPHELIA. O heavenly powers, restore him!HAMLET. I have heard of your paintings too, well enough. God hath givenyou one face, and you make yourselves another. You jig, you amble, andyou lisp, and nickname Godâ€™s creatures, and make your wantonness yourignorance. Go to, Iâ€™ll no more onâ€™t, it hath made me mad. I say, wewill have no more marriages. Those that are married already, all butone, shall live; the rest shall keep as they are. To a nunnery, go. [_Exit._]OPHELIA. O, what a noble mind is here oâ€™erthrown! The courtierâ€™s,soldierâ€™s, scholarâ€™s, eye, tongue, sword, Thâ€™expectancy and rose of thefair state, The glass of fashion and the mould of form, Thâ€™observâ€™d ofall observers, quite, quite down! And I, of ladies most deject andwretched, That suckâ€™d the honey of his music vows, Now see that nobleand most sovereign reason, Like sweet bells jangled out of tune andharsh, That unmatchâ€™d form and feature of blown youth Blasted withecstasy. O woe is me, Tâ€™have seen what I have seen, see what I see. Enter King and Polonius.KING. Love? His affections do not that way tend, Nor what he spake,though it lackâ€™d form a little, Was not like madness. Thereâ€™s somethingin his soul Oâ€™er which his melancholy sits on brood, And I do doubt thehatch and the disclose Will be some danger, which for to prevent, Ihave in quick determination Thus set it down: he shall with speed toEngland For the demand of our neglected tribute: Haply the seas andcountries different, With variable objects, shall expel This somethingsettled matter in his heart, Whereon his brains still beating puts himthus From fashion of himself. What think you onâ€™t?POLONIUS. It shall do well. But yet do I believe The origin andcommencement of his grief Sprung from neglected love. How now, Ophelia?You need not tell us what Lord Hamlet said, We heard it all. My lord,do as you please, But if you hold it fit, after the play, Let his queenmother all alone entreat him To show his grief, let her be round withhim, And Iâ€™ll be placâ€™d, so please you, in the ear Of all theirconference. If she find him not, To England send him; or confine himwhere Your wisdom best shall think.KING. It shall be so. Madness in great ones must not unwatchâ€™d go. [_Exeunt._]SCENE II. A hall in the Castle. Enter Hamlet and certain Players.HAMLET. Speak the speech, I pray you, as I pronounced it to you,trippingly on the tongue. But if you mouth it, as many of your playersdo, I had as lief the town-crier spoke my lines. Nor do not saw the airtoo much with your hand, thus, but use all gently; for in the verytorrent, tempest, and, as I may say, whirlwind of passion, you mustacquire and beget a temperance that may give it smoothness. O, itoffends me to the soul to hear a robustious periwig-pated fellow tear apassion to tatters, to very rags, to split the ears of the groundlings,who, for the most part, are capable of nothing but inexplicable dumbshows and noise. I would have such a fellow whipped for oâ€™erdoingTermagant. It out-Herods Herod. Pray you avoid it.FIRST PLAYER. I warrant your honour.HAMLET. Be not too tame neither; but let your own discretion be yourtutor. Suit the action to the word, the word to the action, with thisspecial observance, that you oâ€™erstep not the modesty of nature; foranything so overdone is from the purpose of playing, whose end, both atthe first and now, was and is, to hold as â€™twere the mirror up tonature; to show virtue her own feature, scorn her own image, and thevery age and body of the time his form and pressure. Now, thisoverdone, or come tardy off, though it make the unskilful laugh, cannotbut make the judicious grieve; the censure of the which one must inyour allowance oâ€™erweigh a whole theatre of others. O, there be playersthat I have seen playâ€”and heard others praise, and that highlyâ€”not tospeak it profanely, that, neither having the accent of Christians, northe gait of Christian, pagan, nor man, have so strutted and bellowedthat I have thought some of Natureâ€™s journeymen had made men, and notmade them well, they imitated humanity so abominably.FIRST PLAYER. I hope we have reformâ€™d that indifferently with us, sir.HAMLET. O reform it altogether. And let those that play your clownsspeak no more than is set down for them. For there be of them that willthemselves laugh, to set on some quantity of barren spectators to laughtoo, though in the meantime some necessary question of the play be thento be considered. Thatâ€™s villanous, and shows a most pitiful ambitionin the fool that uses it. Go make you ready. [_Exeunt Players._] Enter Polonius, Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.How now, my lord? Will the King hear this piece of work?POLONIUS. And the Queen too, and that presently.HAMLET. Bid the players make haste. [_Exit Polonius._]Will you two help to hasten them?ROSENCRANTZ and GUILDENSTERN. We will, my lord. [_Exeunt Rosencrantz and Guildenstern._]HAMLET. What ho, Horatio! Enter Horatio.HORATIO. Here, sweet lord, at your service.HAMLET. Horatio, thou art eâ€™en as just a man As eâ€™er my conversationcopâ€™d withal.HORATIO. O my dear lord.HAMLET. Nay, do not think I flatter; For what advancement may I hopefrom thee, That no revenue hast, but thy good spirits To feed andclothe thee? Why should the poor be flatterâ€™d? No, let the candiedtongue lick absurd pomp, And crook the pregnant hinges of the kneeWhere thrift may follow fawning. Dost thou hear? Since my dear soul wasmistress of her choice, And could of men distinguish, her election Hathsealâ€™d thee for herself. For thou hast been As one, in suffering all,that suffers nothing, A man that Fortuneâ€™s buffets and rewards Hasttaâ€™en with equal thanks. And blesâ€™d are those Whose blood and judgmentare so well co-mingled That they are not a pipe for Fortuneâ€™s finger Tosound what stop she please. Give me that man That is not passionâ€™sslave, and I will wear him In my heartâ€™s core, ay, in my heart ofheart, As I do thee. Something too much of this. There is a playtonight before the King. One scene of it comes near the circumstanceWhich I have told thee, of my fatherâ€™s death. I prythee, when thouseeâ€™st that act a-foot, Even with the very comment of thy soul Observemine uncle. If his occulted guilt Do not itself unkennel in one speech,It is a damned ghost that we have seen; And my imaginations are as foulAs Vulcanâ€™s stithy. Give him heedful note; For I mine eyes will rivetto his face; And after we will both our judgments join In censure ofhis seeming.HORATIO. Well, my lord. If he steal aught the whilst this play isplaying, And scape detecting, I will pay the theft.HAMLET. They are coming to the play. I must be idle. Get you a place. Danish march. A flourish. Enter King, Queen, Polonius, Ophelia, Rosencrantz, Guildenstern and others.KING. How fares our cousin Hamlet?HAMLET. Excellent, iâ€™ faith; of the chameleonâ€™s dish: I eat the air,promise-crammed: you cannot feed capons so.KING. I have nothing with this answer, Hamlet; these words are notmine.HAMLET. No, nor mine now. [_To Polonius._] My lord, you playâ€™d once iâ€™thâ€™university, you say?POLONIUS. That did I, my lord, and was accounted a good actor.HAMLET. What did you enact?POLONIUS. I did enact Julius Caesar. I was killâ€™d iâ€™ thâ€™ Capitol.Brutus killed me.HAMLET. It was a brute part of him to kill so capital a calf there. Bethe players ready?ROSENCRANTZ. Ay, my lord; they stay upon your patience.QUEEN. Come hither, my dear Hamlet, sit by me.HAMLET. No, good mother, hereâ€™s metal more attractive.POLONIUS. [_To the King._] O ho! do you mark that?HAMLET. Lady, shall I lie in your lap? [_Lying down at Opheliaâ€™s feet._]OPHELIA. No, my lord.HAMLET. I mean, my head upon your lap?OPHELIA. Ay, my lord.HAMLET. Do you think I meant country matters?OPHELIA. I think nothing, my lord.HAMLET. Thatâ€™s a fair thought to lie between maidsâ€™ legs.OPHELIA. What is, my lord?HAMLET. Nothing.OPHELIA. You are merry, my lord.HAMLET. Who, I?OPHELIA. Ay, my lord.HAMLET. O God, your only jig-maker! What should a man do but be merry?For look you how cheerfully my mother looks, and my father diedwithinâ€™s two hours.OPHELIA. Nay, â€™tis twice two months, my lord.HAMLET. So long? Nay then, let the devil wear black, for Iâ€™ll have asuit of sables. O heavens! die two months ago, and not forgotten yet?Then thereâ€™s hope a great manâ€™s memory may outlive his life half ayear. But byâ€™r lady, he must build churches then; or else shall hesuffer not thinking on, with the hobby-horse, whose epitaph is â€˜For, O,for O, the hobby-horse is forgot!â€™ Trumpets sound. The dumb show enters._Enter a King and a Queen very lovingly; the Queen embracing him and heher. She kneels, and makes show of protestation unto him. He takes herup, and declines his head upon her neck. Lays him down upon a bank offlowers. She, seeing him asleep, leaves him. Anon comes in a fellow,takes off his crown, kisses it, pours poison in the Kingâ€™s ears, andexits. The Queen returns, finds the King dead, and makes passionateaction. The Poisoner with some three or four Mutes, comes in again,seeming to lament with her. The dead body is carried away. The Poisonerwoos the Queen with gifts. She seems loth and unwilling awhile, but inthe end accepts his love._ [_Exeunt._]OPHELIA. What means this, my lord?HAMLET. Marry, this is miching mallicho; it means mischief.OPHELIA. Belike this show imports the argument of the play. Enter Prologue.HAMLET. We shall know by this fellow: the players cannot keep counsel;theyâ€™ll tell all.OPHELIA. Will they tell us what this show meant?HAMLET. Ay, or any show that youâ€™ll show him. Be not you ashamed toshow, heâ€™ll not shame to tell you what it means.OPHELIA. You are naught, you are naught: Iâ€™ll mark the play.PROLOGUE. _For us, and for our tragedy, Here stooping to your clemency,We beg your hearing patiently._HAMLET. Is this a prologue, or the posy of a ring?OPHELIA. â€™Tis brief, my lord.HAMLET. As womanâ€™s love. Enter a King and a Queen.PLAYER KING. Full thirty times hath Phoebusâ€™ cart gone round Neptuneâ€™ssalt wash and Tellusâ€™ orbed ground, And thirty dozen moons withborrowâ€™d sheen About the world have times twelve thirties been, Sincelove our hearts, and Hymen did our hands Unite commutual in most sacredbands.PLAYER QUEEN. So many journeys may the sun and moon Make us again countoâ€™er ere love be done. But, woe is me, you are so sick of late, So farfrom cheer and from your former state, That I distrust you. Yet, thoughI distrust, Discomfort you, my lord, it nothing must: For womenâ€™s fearand love holds quantity, In neither aught, or in extremity. Now what mylove is, proof hath made you know, And as my love is sizâ€™d, my fear isso. Where love is great, the littlest doubts are fear; Where littlefears grow great, great love grows there.PLAYER KING. Faith, I must leave thee, love, and shortly too: Myoperant powers their functions leave to do: And thou shalt live in thisfair world behind, Honourâ€™d, belovâ€™d, and haply one as kind For husbandshalt thouâ€”PLAYER QUEEN. O confound the rest. Such love must needs be treason inmy breast. In second husband let me be accurst! None wed the second butwho killâ€™d the first.HAMLET. [_Aside._] Wormwood, wormwood.PLAYER QUEEN. The instances that second marriage move Are base respectsof thrift, but none of love. A second time I kill my husband dead, Whensecond husband kisses me in bed.PLAYER KING. I do believe you think what now you speak; But what we dodetermine, oft we break. Purpose is but the slave to memory, Of violentbirth, but poor validity: Which now, like fruit unripe, sticks on thetree, But fall unshaken when they mellow be. Most necessary â€™tis thatwe forget To pay ourselves what to ourselves is debt. What to ourselvesin passion we propose, The passion ending, doth the purpose lose. Theviolence of either grief or joy Their own enactures with themselvesdestroy. Where joy most revels, grief doth most lament; Grief joys, joygrieves, on slender accident. This world is not for aye; nor â€™tis notstrange That even our loves should with our fortunes change, For â€™tis aquestion left us yet to prove, Whether love lead fortune, or elsefortune love. The great man down, you mark his favourite flies, Thepoor advancâ€™d makes friends of enemies; And hitherto doth love onfortune tend: For who not needs shall never lack a friend, And who inwant a hollow friend doth try, Directly seasons him his enemy. Butorderly to end where I begun, Our wills and fates do so contrary runThat our devices still are overthrown. Our thoughts are ours, theirends none of our own. So think thou wilt no second husband wed, But diethy thoughts when thy first lord is dead.PLAYER QUEEN. Nor earth to me give food, nor heaven light, Sport andrepose lock from me day and night, To desperation turn my trust andhope, An anchorâ€™s cheer in prison be my scope, Each opposite thatblanks the face of joy, Meet what I would have well, and it destroy!Both here and hence pursue me lasting strife, If, once a widow, ever Ibe wife.HAMLET. [_To Ophelia._] If she should break it now.PLAYER KING. â€™Tis deeply sworn. Sweet, leave me here awhile. My spiritsgrow dull, and fain I would beguile The tedious day with sleep.[_Sleeps._]PLAYER QUEEN. Sleep rock thy brain, And never come mischance between ustwain. [_Exit._]HAMLET. Madam, how like you this play?QUEEN. The lady protests too much, methinks.HAMLET. O, but sheâ€™ll keep her word.KING. Have you heard the argument? Is there no offence inâ€™t?HAMLET. No, no, they do but jest, poison in jest; no offence iâ€™ thâ€™world.KING. What do you call the play?HAMLET. _The Mousetrap._ Marry, how? Tropically. This play is the imageof a murder done in Vienna. Gonzago is the Dukeâ€™s name, his wifeBaptista: you shall see anon; â€™tis a knavish piece of work: but what oâ€™that? Your majesty, and we that have free souls, it touches us not. Letthe gallâ€™d jade wince; our withers are unwrung. Enter Lucianus.This is one Lucianus, nephew to the King.OPHELIA. You are a good chorus, my lord.HAMLET. I could interpret between you and your love, if I could see thepuppets dallying.OPHELIA. You are keen, my lord, you are keen.HAMLET. It would cost you a groaning to take off my edge.OPHELIA. Still better, and worse.HAMLET. So you mistake your husbands.â€”Begin, murderer. Pox, leave thydamnable faces, and begin. Come, the croaking raven doth bellow forrevenge.LUCIANUS. Thoughts black, hands apt, drugs fit, and time agreeing,Confederate season, else no creature seeing; Thou mixture rank, ofmidnight weeds collected, With Hecateâ€™s ban thrice blasted, thriceinfected, Thy natural magic and dire property On wholesome life usurpimmediately. [_Pours the poison into the sleeperâ€™s ears._]HAMLET. He poisons him iâ€™ thâ€™garden forâ€™s estate. His nameâ€™s Gonzago.The story is extant, and written in very choice Italian. You shall seeanon how the murderer gets the love of Gonzagoâ€™s wife.OPHELIA. The King rises.HAMLET. What, frighted with false fire?QUEEN. How fares my lord?POLONIUS. Give oâ€™er the play.KING. Give me some light. Away.All. Lights, lights, lights. [_Exeunt all but Hamlet and Horatio._]HAMLET. Why, let the strucken deer go weep, The hart ungalled play; Forsome must watch, while some must sleep, So runs the world away. Wouldnot this, sir, and a forest of feathers, if the rest of my fortunesturn Turk with me; with two Provincial roses on my razed shoes, get mea fellowship in a cry of players, sir?HORATIO. Half a share.HAMLET. A whole one, I. For thou dost know, O Damon dear, This realmdismantled was Of Jove himself, and now reigns here A very,veryâ€”pajock.HORATIO. You might have rhymed.HAMLET. O good Horatio, Iâ€™ll take the ghostâ€™s word for a thousandpound. Didst perceive?HORATIO. Very well, my lord.HAMLET. Upon the talk of the poisoning?HORATIO. I did very well note him.HAMLET. Ah, ha! Come, some music. Come, the recorders. For if the kinglike not the comedy, Why then, belike he likes it not, perdie. Come,some music. Enter Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.GUILDENSTERN. Good my lord, vouchsafe me a word with you.HAMLET. Sir, a whole history.GUILDENSTERN. The King, sirâ€”HAMLET. Ay, sir, what of him?GUILDENSTERN. Is in his retirement, marvellous distempered.HAMLET. With drink, sir?GUILDENSTERN. No, my lord; rather with choler.HAMLET. Your wisdom should show itself more richer to signify this tothe doctor, for me to put him to his purgation would perhaps plunge himinto far more choler.GUILDENSTERN. Good my lord, put your discourse into some frame, andstart not so wildly from my affair.HAMLET. I am tame, sir, pronounce.GUILDENSTERN. The Queen your mother, in most great affliction ofspirit, hath sent me to you.HAMLET. You are welcome.GUILDENSTERN. Nay, good my lord, this courtesy is not of the rightbreed. If it shall please you to make me a wholesome answer, I will doyour motherâ€™s commandment; if not, your pardon and my return shall bethe end of my business.HAMLET. Sir, I cannot.GUILDENSTERN. What, my lord?HAMLET. Make you a wholesome answer. My witâ€™s diseased. But, sir, suchanswer as I can make, you shall command; or rather, as you say, mymother. Therefore no more, but to the matter. My mother, you say,â€”ROSENCRANTZ. Then thus she says: your behaviour hath struck her intoamazement and admiration.HAMLET. O wonderful son, that can so stonish a mother! But is there nosequel at the heels of this motherâ€™s admiration?ROSENCRANTZ. She desires to speak with you in her closet ere you go tobed.HAMLET. We shall obey, were she ten times our mother. Have you anyfurther trade with us?ROSENCRANTZ. My lord, you once did love me.HAMLET. And so I do still, by these pickers and stealers.ROSENCRANTZ. Good my lord, what is your cause of distemper? You dosurely bar the door upon your own liberty if you deny your griefs toyour friend.HAMLET. Sir, I lack advancement.ROSENCRANTZ. How can that be, when you have the voice of the Kinghimself for your succession in Denmark?HAMLET. Ay, sir, but while the grass growsâ€”the proverb is somethingmusty. Re-enter the Players with recorders.O, the recorders. Let me see one.â€”To withdraw with you, why do you goabout to recover the wind of me, as if you would drive me into a toil?GUILDENSTERN. O my lord, if my duty be too bold, my love is toounmannerly.HAMLET. I do not well understand that. Will you play upon this pipe?GUILDENSTERN. My lord, I cannot.HAMLET. I pray you.GUILDENSTERN. Believe me, I cannot.HAMLET. I do beseech you.GUILDENSTERN. I know no touch of it, my lord.HAMLET. â€™Tis as easy as lying: govern these ventages with your fingerand thumb, give it breath with your mouth, and it will discourse mosteloquent music. Look you, these are the stops.GUILDENSTERN. But these cannot I command to any utterance of harmony. Ihave not the skill.HAMLET. Why, look you now, how unworthy a thing you make of me! Youwould play upon me; you would seem to know my stops; you would pluckout the heart of my mystery; you would sound me from my lowest note tothe top of my compass; and there is much music, excellent voice, inthis little organ, yet cannot you make it speak. â€™Sblood, do you thinkI am easier to be played on than a pipe? Call me what instrument youwill, though you can fret me, you cannot play upon me. Enter Polonius.God bless you, sir.POLONIUS. My lord, the Queen would speak with you, and presently.HAMLET. Do you see yonder cloud thatâ€™s almost in shape of a camel?POLONIUS. By the mass, and â€™tis like a camel indeed.HAMLET. Methinks it is like a weasel.POLONIUS. It is backed like a weasel.HAMLET. Or like a whale.POLONIUS. Very like a whale.HAMLET. Then will I come to my mother by and by.â€”They fool me to thetop of my bent.â€”I will come by and by.POLONIUS. I will say so. [_Exit._]HAMLET. By and by is easily said. Leave me, friends. [_Exeunt all but Hamlet._]â€™Tis now the very witching time of night, When churchyards yawn, andhell itself breathes out Contagion to this world. Now could I drink hotblood, And do such bitter business as the day Would quake to look on.Soft now, to my mother. O heart, lose not thy nature; let not ever Thesoul of Nero enter this firm bosom: Let me be cruel, not unnatural. Iwill speak daggers to her, but use none; My tongue and soul in this behypocrites. How in my words somever she be shent, To give them sealsnever, my soul, consent. [_Exit._]SCENE III. A room in the Castle. Enter King, Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.KING. I like him not, nor stands it safe with us To let his madnessrange. Therefore prepare you, I your commission will forthwithdispatch, And he to England shall along with you. The terms of ourestate may not endure Hazard so near us as doth hourly grow Out of hislunacies.GUILDENSTERN. We will ourselves provide. Most holy and religious fearit is To keep those many many bodies safe That live and feed upon yourMajesty.ROSENCRANTZ. The single and peculiar life is bound With all thestrength and armour of the mind, To keep itself from â€™noyance; but muchmore That spirit upon whose weal depend and rest The lives of many. Thecease of majesty Dies not alone; but like a gulf doth draw Whatâ€™s nearit with it. It is a massy wheel Fixâ€™d on the summit of the highestmount, To whose huge spokes ten thousand lesser things Are mortisâ€™d andadjoinâ€™d; which when it falls, Each small annexment, petty consequence,Attends the boistâ€™rous ruin. Never alone Did the King sigh, but with ageneral groan.KING. Arm you, I pray you, to this speedy voyage; For we will fettersput upon this fear, Which now goes too free-footed.ROSENCRANTZ and GUILDENSTERN. We will haste us. [_Exeunt Rosencrantz and Guildenstern._] Enter Polonius.POLONIUS. My lord, heâ€™s going to his motherâ€™s closet. Behind the arrasIâ€™ll convey myself To hear the process. Iâ€™ll warrant sheâ€™ll tax himhome, And as you said, and wisely was it said, â€™Tis meet that some moreaudience than a mother, Since nature makes them partial, shouldoâ€™erhear The speech of vantage. Fare you well, my liege, Iâ€™ll call uponyou ere you go to bed, And tell you what I know.KING. Thanks, dear my lord. [_Exit Polonius._]O, my offence is rank, it smells to heaven; It hath the primal eldestcurse uponâ€™t,â€” A brotherâ€™s murder! Pray can I not, Though inclinationbe as sharp as will: My stronger guilt defeats my strong intent, And,like a man to double business bound, I stand in pause where I shallfirst begin, And both neglect. What if this cursed hand Were thickerthan itself with brotherâ€™s blood, Is there not rain enough in the sweetheavens To wash it white as snow? Whereto serves mercy But to confrontthe visage of offence? And whatâ€™s in prayer but this twofold force, Tobe forestalled ere we come to fall, Or pardonâ€™d being down? Then Iâ€™lllook up. My fault is past. But O, what form of prayer Can serve myturn? Forgive me my foul murder! That cannot be; since I am stillpossessâ€™d Of those effects for which I did the murder,â€” My crown, mineown ambition, and my queen. May one be pardonâ€™d and retain thâ€™offence?In the corrupted currents of this world Offenceâ€™s gilded hand may shoveby justice, And oft â€™tis seen the wicked prize itself Buys out the law.But â€™tis not so above; There is no shuffling, there the action lies Inhis true nature, and we ourselves compellâ€™d Even to the teeth andforehead of our faults, To give in evidence. What then? What rests? Trywhat repentance can. What can it not? Yet what can it, when one cannotrepent? O wretched state! O bosom black as death! O limed soul, thatstruggling to be free, Art more engagâ€™d! Help, angels! Make assay: Bow,stubborn knees; and heart with strings of steel, Be soft as sinews ofthe new-born babe. All may be well. [_Retires and kneels._] Enter Hamlet.HAMLET. Now might I do it pat, now he is praying. And now Iâ€™ll doâ€™t.And so he goes to heaven; And so am I revengâ€™d. That would be scannâ€™d:A villain kills my father, and for that I, his sole son, do this samevillain send To heaven. O, this is hire and salary, not revenge. Hetook my father grossly, full of bread, With all his crimes broad blown,as flush as May; And how his audit stands, who knows save heaven? Butin our circumstance and course of thought, â€™Tis heavy with him. And amI then revengâ€™d, To take him in the purging of his soul, When he is fitand seasonâ€™d for his passage? No. Up, sword, and know thou a morehorrid hent: When he is drunk asleep; or in his rage, Or inthâ€™incestuous pleasure of his bed, At gaming, swearing; or about someact That has no relish of salvation inâ€™t, Then trip him, that his heelsmay kick at heaven, And that his soul may be as damnâ€™d and black Ashell, whereto it goes. My mother stays. This physic but prolongs thysickly days. [_Exit._] The King rises and advances.KING. My words fly up, my thoughts remain below. Words without thoughtsnever to heaven go. [_Exit._]SCENE IV. Another room in the Castle. Enter Queen and Polonius.POLONIUS. He will come straight. Look you lay home to him, Tell him hispranks have been too broad to bear with, And that your Grace hathscreenâ€™d and stood between Much heat and him. Iâ€™ll silence me eâ€™enhere. Pray you be round with him.HAMLET. [_Within._] Mother, mother, mother.QUEEN. Iâ€™ll warrant you, Fear me not. Withdraw, I hear him coming. [_Polonius goes behind the arras._] Enter Hamlet.HAMLET. Now, mother, whatâ€™s the matter?QUEEN. Hamlet, thou hast thy father much offended.HAMLET. Mother, you have my father much offended.QUEEN. Come, come, you answer with an idle tongue.HAMLET. Go, go, you question with a wicked tongue.QUEEN. Why, how now, Hamlet?HAMLET. Whatâ€™s the matter now?QUEEN. Have you forgot me?HAMLET. No, by the rood, not so. You are the Queen, your husbandâ€™sbrotherâ€™s wife, And, would it were not so. You are my mother.QUEEN. Nay, then Iâ€™ll set those to you that can speak.HAMLET. Come, come, and sit you down, you shall not budge. You go nottill I set you up a glass Where you may see the inmost part of you.QUEEN. What wilt thou do? Thou wilt not murder me? Help, help, ho!POLONIUS. [_Behind._] What, ho! help, help, help!HAMLET. How now? A rat? [_Draws._] Dead for a ducat, dead! [_Makes a pass through the arras._]POLONIUS. [_Behind._] O, I am slain! [_Falls and dies._]QUEEN. O me, what hast thou done?HAMLET. Nay, I know not. is it the King? [_Draws forth Polonius._]QUEEN. O what a rash and bloody deed is this!HAMLET. A bloody deed. Almost as bad, good mother, As kill a king andmarry with his brother.QUEEN. As kill a king?HAMLET. Ay, lady, â€™twas my word.â€” [_To Polonius._] Thou wretched, rash,intruding fool, farewell! I took thee for thy better. Take thy fortune,Thou findâ€™st to be too busy is some danger.â€” Leave wringing of yourhands. Peace, sit you down, And let me wring your heart, for so Ishall, If it be made of penetrable stuff; If damned custom have notbrazâ€™d it so, That it is proof and bulwark against sense.QUEEN. What have I done, that thou darâ€™st wag thy tongue In noise sorude against me?HAMLET. Such an act That blurs the grace and blush of modesty, Callsvirtue hypocrite, takes off the rose From the fair forehead of aninnocent love, And sets a blister there. Makes marriage vows As falseas dicersâ€™ oaths. O such a deed As from the body of contraction plucksThe very soul, and sweet religion makes A rhapsody of words. Heavenâ€™sface doth glow, Yea this solidity and compound mass, With tristfulvisage, as against the doom, Is thought-sick at the act.QUEEN. Ay me, what act, That roars so loud, and thunders in the index?HAMLET. Look here upon this picture, and on this, The counterfeitpresentment of two brothers. See what a grace was seated on this brow,Hyperionâ€™s curls, the front of Jove himself, An eye like Mars, tothreaten and command, A station like the herald Mercury New lighted ona heaven-kissing hill: A combination and a form indeed, Where every goddid seem to set his seal, To give the world assurance of a man. Thiswas your husband. Look you now what follows. Here is your husband, likea mildewâ€™d ear Blasting his wholesome brother. Have you eyes? Could youon this fair mountain leave to feed, And batten on this moor? Ha! haveyou eyes? You cannot call it love; for at your age The hey-day in theblood is tame, itâ€™s humble, And waits upon the judgment: and whatjudgment Would step from this to this? Sense sure you have, Else couldyou not have motion; but sure that sense Is apoplexâ€™d, for madnesswould not err Nor sense to ecstacy was neâ€™er so thrallâ€™d But itreservâ€™d some quantity of choice To serve in such a difference. Whatdevil wasâ€™t That thus hath cozenâ€™d you at hoodman-blind? Eyes withoutfeeling, feeling without sight, Ears without hands or eyes, smellingsans all, Or but a sickly part of one true sense Could not so mope. Oshame! where is thy blush? Rebellious hell, If thou canst mutine in amatronâ€™s bones, To flaming youth let virtue be as wax, And melt in herown fire. Proclaim no shame When the compulsive ardour gives thecharge, Since frost itself as actively doth burn, And reason panderswill.QUEEN. O Hamlet, speak no more. Thou turnâ€™st mine eyes into my verysoul, And there I see such black and grained spots As will not leavetheir tinct.HAMLET. Nay, but to live In the rank sweat of an enseamed bed, Stewâ€™din corruption, honeying and making love Over the nasty sty.QUEEN. O speak to me no more; These words like daggers enter in mineears; No more, sweet Hamlet.HAMLET. A murderer and a villain; A slave that is not twentieth partthe tithe Of your precedent lord. A vice of kings, A cutpurse of theempire and the rule, That from a shelf the precious diadem stole Andput it in his pocket!QUEEN. No more.HAMLET. A king of shreds and patches!â€” Enter Ghost.Save me and hover oâ€™er me with your wings, You heavenly guards! Whatwould your gracious figure?QUEEN. Alas, heâ€™s mad.HAMLET. Do you not come your tardy son to chide, That, lapsâ€™d in timeand passion, lets go by The important acting of your dread command? Osay!GHOST. Do not forget. This visitation Is but to whet thy almost bluntedpurpose. But look, amazement on thy mother sits. O step between her andher fighting soul. Conceit in weakest bodies strongest works. Speak toher, Hamlet.HAMLET. How is it with you, lady?QUEEN. Alas, how isâ€™t with you, That you do bend your eye on vacancy,And with the incorporal air do hold discourse? Forth at your eyes yourspirits wildly peep, And, as the sleeping soldiers in the alarm, Yourbedded hairs, like life in excrements, Start up and stand an end. Ogentle son, Upon the heat and flame of thy distemper Sprinkle coolpatience. Whereon do you look?HAMLET. On him, on him! Look you how pale he glares, His form and causeconjoinâ€™d, preaching to stones, Would make them capable.â€”Do not lookupon me, Lest with this piteous action you convert My stern effects.Then what I have to do Will want true colour; tears perchance forblood.QUEEN. To whom do you speak this?HAMLET. Do you see nothing there?QUEEN. Nothing at all; yet all that is I see.HAMLET. Nor did you nothing hear?QUEEN. No, nothing but ourselves.HAMLET. Why, look you there! look how it steals away! My father, in hishabit as he livâ€™d! Look where he goes even now out at the portal. [_Exit Ghost._]QUEEN. This is the very coinage of your brain. This bodiless creationecstasy Is very cunning in.HAMLET. Ecstasy! My pulse as yours doth temperately keep time, Andmakes as healthful music. It is not madness That I have utterâ€™d. Bringme to the test, And I the matter will re-word; which madness Wouldgambol from. Mother, for love of grace, Lay not that flattering unctionto your soul That not your trespass, but my madness speaks. It will butskin and film the ulcerous place, Whilst rank corruption, mining allwithin, Infects unseen. Confess yourself to heaven, Repent whatâ€™s past,avoid what is to come; And do not spread the compost on the weeds, Tomake them ranker. Forgive me this my virtue; For in the fatness ofthese pursy times Virtue itself of vice must pardon beg, Yea, curb andwoo for leave to do him good.QUEEN. O Hamlet, thou hast cleft my heart in twain.HAMLET. O throw away the worser part of it, And live the purer with theother half. Good night. But go not to mine uncleâ€™s bed. Assume avirtue, if you have it not. That monster custom, who all sense dotheat, Of habits evil, is angel yet in this, That to the use of actionsfair and good He likewise gives a frock or livery That aptly is put on.Refrain tonight, And that shall lend a kind of easiness To the nextabstinence. The next more easy; For use almost can change the stamp ofnature, And either curb the devil, or throw him out With wondrouspotency. Once more, good night, And when you are desirous to be blesâ€™d,Iâ€™ll blessing beg of you. For this same lord [_Pointing to Polonius._]I do repent; but heaven hath pleasâ€™d it so, To punish me with this, andthis with me, That I must be their scourge and minister. I will bestowhim, and will answer well The death I gave him. So again, good night. Imust be cruel, only to be kind: Thus bad begins, and worse remainsbehind. One word more, good lady.QUEEN. What shall I do?HAMLET. Not this, by no means, that I bid you do: Let the bloat Kingtempt you again to bed, Pinch wanton on your cheek, call you his mouse,And let him, for a pair of reechy kisses, Or paddling in your neck withhis damnâ€™d fingers, Make you to ravel all this matter out, That Iessentially am not in madness, But mad in craft. â€™Twere good you lethim know, For who thatâ€™s but a queen, fair, sober, wise, Would from apaddock, from a bat, a gib, Such dear concernings hide? Who would doso? No, in despite of sense and secrecy, Unpeg the basket on thehouseâ€™s top, Let the birds fly, and like the famous ape, To tryconclusions, in the basket creep And break your own neck down.QUEEN. Be thou assurâ€™d, if words be made of breath, And breath of life,I have no life to breathe What thou hast said to me.HAMLET. I must to England, you know that?QUEEN. Alack, I had forgot. â€™Tis so concluded on.HAMLET. Thereâ€™s letters sealâ€™d: and my two schoolfellows, Whom I willtrust as I will adders fangâ€™d,â€” They bear the mandate, they must sweepmy way And marshal me to knavery. Let it work; For â€™tis the sport tohave the enginer Hoist with his own petard, and â€™t shall go hard But Iwill delve one yard below their mines And blow them at the moon. O,â€™tis most sweet, When in one line two crafts directly meet. This manshall set me packing. Iâ€™ll lug the guts into the neighbour room.Mother, good night. Indeed, this counsellor Is now most still, mostsecret, and most grave, Who was in life a foolish peating knave. Come,sir, to draw toward an end with you. Good night, mother. [_Exit Hamlet dragging out Polonius._]ACT IVSCENE I. A room in the Castle. Enter King, Queen, Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.KING. Thereâ€™s matter in these sighs. These profound heaves You musttranslate. â€™tis fit we understand them. Where is your son?QUEEN. Bestow this place on us a little while. [_To Rosencrantz and Guildenstern, who go out._]Ah, my good lord, what have I seen tonight!KING. What, Gertrude? How does Hamlet?QUEEN. Mad as the sea and wind, when both contend Which is themightier. In his lawless fit Behind the arras hearing something stir,Whips out his rapier, cries â€˜A rat, a rat!â€™ And in this brainishapprehension kills The unseen good old man.KING. O heavy deed! It had been so with us, had we been there. Hisliberty is full of threats to all; To you yourself, to us, to everyone.Alas, how shall this bloody deed be answerâ€™d? It will be laid to us,whose providence Should have kept short, restrainâ€™d, and out of hauntThis mad young man. But so much was our love We would not understandwhat was most fit, But like the owner of a foul disease, To keep itfrom divulging, let it feed Even on the pith of life. Where is he gone?QUEEN. To draw apart the body he hath killâ€™d, Oâ€™er whom his verymadness, like some ore Among a mineral of metals base, Shows itselfpure. He weeps for what is done.KING. O Gertrude, come away! The sun no sooner shall the mountainstouch But we will ship him hence, and this vile deed We must with allour majesty and skill Both countenance and excuse.â€”Ho, Guildenstern! Re-enter Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.Friends both, go join you with some further aid: Hamlet in madness hathPolonius slain, And from his motherâ€™s closet hath he draggâ€™d him. Goseek him out, speak fair, and bring the body Into the chapel. I prayyou haste in this. [_Exeunt Rosencrantz and Guildenstern._]Come, Gertrude, weâ€™ll call up our wisest friends, And let them knowboth what we mean to do And whatâ€™s untimely done, so haply slander,Whose whisper oâ€™er the worldâ€™s diameter, As level as the cannon to hisblank, Transports his poisonâ€™d shot, may miss our name, And hit thewoundless air. O, come away! My soul is full of discord and dismay. [_Exeunt._]SCENE II. Another room in the Castle. Enter Hamlet.HAMLET. Safely stowed.ROSENCRANTZ and GUILDENSTERN. [_Within._] Hamlet! Lord Hamlet!HAMLET. What noise? Who calls on Hamlet? O, here they come. Enter Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.ROSENCRANTZ. What have you done, my lord, with the dead body?HAMLET. Compounded it with dust, whereto â€™tis kin.ROSENCRANTZ. Tell us where â€™tis, that we may take it thence, And bearit to the chapel.HAMLET. Do not believe it.ROSENCRANTZ. Believe what?HAMLET. That I can keep your counsel, and not mine own. Besides, to bedemanded of a spongeâ€”what replication should be made by the son of aking?ROSENCRANTZ. Take you me for a sponge, my lord?HAMLET. Ay, sir; that soaks up the Kingâ€™s countenance, his rewards, hisauthorities. But such officers do the King best service in the end: hekeeps them, like an ape, in the corner of his jaw; first mouthed, to belast swallowed: when he needs what you have gleaned, it is butsqueezing you, and, sponge, you shall be dry again.ROSENCRANTZ. I understand you not, my lord.HAMLET. I am glad of it. A knavish speech sleeps in a foolish ear.ROSENCRANTZ. My lord, you must tell us where the body is and go with usto the King.HAMLET. The body is with the King, but the King is not with the body.The King is a thingâ€”GUILDENSTERN. A thing, my lord!HAMLET. Of nothing. Bring me to him. Hide fox, and all after. [_Exeunt._]SCENE III. Another room in the Castle. Enter King, attended.KING. I have sent to seek him and to find the body. How dangerous is itthat this man goes loose! Yet must not we put the strong law on him:Heâ€™s lovâ€™d of the distracted multitude, Who like not in their judgment,but their eyes; And where â€™tis so, thâ€™offenderâ€™s scourge is weighâ€™d,But never the offence. To bear all smooth and even, This sudden sendinghim away must seem Deliberate pause. Diseases desperate grown Bydesperate appliance are relievâ€™d, Or not at all. Enter Rosencrantz.How now? What hath befallâ€™n?ROSENCRANTZ. Where the dead body is bestowâ€™d, my lord, We cannot getfrom him.KING. But where is he?ROSENCRANTZ. Without, my lord, guarded, to know your pleasure.KING. Bring him before us.ROSENCRANTZ. Ho, Guildenstern! Bring in my lord. Enter Hamlet and Guildenstern.KING. Now, Hamlet, whereâ€™s Polonius?HAMLET. At supper.KING. At supper? Where?HAMLET. Not where he eats, but where he is eaten. A certain convocationof politic worms are eâ€™en at him. Your worm is your only emperor fordiet. We fat all creatures else to fat us, and we fat ourselves formaggots. Your fat king and your lean beggar is but variableservice,â€”two dishes, but to one table. Thatâ€™s the end.KING. Alas, alas!HAMLET. A man may fish with the worm that hath eat of a king, and eatof the fish that hath fed of that worm.KING. What dost thou mean by this?HAMLET. Nothing but to show you how a king may go a progress throughthe guts of a beggar.KING. Where is Polonius?HAMLET. In heaven. Send thither to see. If your messenger find him notthere, seek him iâ€™ thâ€™other place yourself. But indeed, if you find himnot within this month, you shall nose him as you go up the stairs intothe lobby.KING. [_To some Attendants._] Go seek him there.HAMLET. He will stay till you come. [_Exeunt Attendants._]KING. Hamlet, this deed, for thine especial safety,â€” Which we dotender, as we dearly grieve For that which thou hast done,â€”must sendthee hence With fiery quickness. Therefore prepare thyself; The bark isready, and the wind at help, Thâ€™associates tend, and everything is bentFor England.HAMLET. For England?KING. Ay, Hamlet.HAMLET. Good.KING. So is it, if thou knewâ€™st our purposes.HAMLET. I see a cherub that sees them. But, come; for England!Farewell, dear mother.KING. Thy loving father, Hamlet.HAMLET. My mother. Father and mother is man and wife; man and wife isone flesh; and so, my mother. Come, for England. [_Exit._]KING. Follow him at foot. Tempt him with speed aboard; Delay it not;Iâ€™ll have him hence tonight. Away, for everything is sealâ€™d and doneThat else leans on thâ€™affair. Pray you make haste. [_Exeunt Rosencrantz and Guildenstern._]And England, if my love thou holdâ€™st at aught,â€” As my great powerthereof may give thee sense, Since yet thy cicatrice looks raw and redAfter the Danish sword, and thy free awe Pays homage to us,â€”thou maystnot coldly set Our sovereign process, which imports at full, By lettersconjuring to that effect, The present death of Hamlet. Do it, England;For like the hectic in my blood he rages, And thou must cure me. Till Iknow â€™tis done, Howeâ€™er my haps, my joys were neâ€™er begun. [_Exit._]SCENE IV. A plain in Denmark. Enter Fortinbras and Forces marching.FORTINBRAS. Go, Captain, from me greet the Danish king. Tell him thatby his license, Fortinbras Craves the conveyance of a promisâ€™d marchOver his kingdom. You know the rendezvous. If that his Majesty wouldaught with us, We shall express our duty in his eye; And let him knowso.CAPTAIN. I will doâ€™t, my lord.FORTINBRAS. Go softly on. [_Exeunt all but the Captain._] Enter Hamlet, Rosencrantz, Guildenstern &amp;c.HAMLET. Good sir, whose powers are these?CAPTAIN. They are of Norway, sir.HAMLET. How purposâ€™d, sir, I pray you?CAPTAIN. Against some part of Poland.HAMLET. Who commands them, sir?CAPTAIN. The nephew to old Norway, Fortinbras.HAMLET. Goes it against the main of Poland, sir, Or for some frontier?CAPTAIN. Truly to speak, and with no addition, We go to gain a littlepatch of ground That hath in it no profit but the name. To pay fiveducats, five, I would not farm it; Nor will it yield to Norway or thePole A ranker rate, should it be sold in fee.HAMLET. Why, then the Polack never will defend it.CAPTAIN. Yes, it is already garrisonâ€™d.HAMLET. Two thousand souls and twenty thousand ducats Will not debatethe question of this straw! This is thâ€™imposthume of much wealth andpeace, That inward breaks, and shows no cause without Why the man dies.I humbly thank you, sir.CAPTAIN. God bâ€™ wiâ€™ you, sir. [_Exit._]ROSENCRANTZ. Willâ€™t please you go, my lord?HAMLET. Iâ€™ll be with you straight. Go a little before. [_Exeunt all but Hamlet._]How all occasions do inform against me, And spur my dull revenge. Whatis a man If his chief good and market of his time Be but to sleep andfeed? A beast, no more. Sure he that made us with such large discourse,Looking before and after, gave us not That capability and godlikereason To fust in us unusâ€™d. Now whether it be Bestial oblivion, orsome craven scruple Of thinking too precisely on thâ€™event,â€” A thoughtwhich, quarterâ€™d, hath but one part wisdom And ever three partscoward,â€”I do not know Why yet I live to say this thingâ€™s to do, Sith Ihave cause, and will, and strength, and means To doâ€™t. Examples grossas earth exhort me, Witness this army of such mass and charge, Led by adelicate and tender prince, Whose spirit, with divine ambition puffâ€™d,Makes mouths at the invisible event, Exposing what is mortal and unsureTo all that fortune, death, and danger dare, Even for an eggshell.Rightly to be great Is not to stir without great argument, But greatlyto find quarrel in a straw When honourâ€™s at the stake. How stand Ithen, That have a father killâ€™d, a mother stainâ€™d, Excitements of myreason and my blood, And let all sleep, while to my shame I see Theimminent death of twenty thousand men That, for a fantasy and trick offame, Go to their graves like beds, fight for a plot Whereon thenumbers cannot try the cause, Which is not tomb enough and continent Tohide the slain? O, from this time forth, My thoughts be bloody or benothing worth. [_Exit._]SCENE V. Elsinore. A room in the Castle. Enter Queen, Horatio and a Gentleman.QUEEN. I will not speak with her.GENTLEMAN. She is importunate, indeed distract. Her mood will needs bepitied.QUEEN. What would she have?GENTLEMAN. She speaks much of her father; says she hears Thereâ€™s tricksiâ€™ thâ€™ world, and hems, and beats her heart, Spurns enviously atstraws, speaks things in doubt, That carry but half sense. Her speechis nothing, Yet the unshaped use of it doth move The hearers tocollection; they aim at it, And botch the words up fit to their ownthoughts, Which, as her winks, and nods, and gestures yield them,Indeed would make one think there might be thought, Though nothingsure, yet much unhappily. â€™Twere good she were spoken with, for she maystrew Dangerous conjectures in ill-breeding minds.QUEEN. Let her come in. [_Exit Gentleman._]To my sick soul, as sinâ€™s true nature is, Each toy seems prologue tosome great amiss. So full of artless jealousy is guilt, It spillsitself in fearing to be spilt. Enter Ophelia.OPHELIA. Where is the beauteous Majesty of Denmark?QUEEN. How now, Ophelia?OPHELIA. [_Sings._] How should I your true love know From another one?By his cockle bat and staff And his sandal shoon.QUEEN. Alas, sweet lady, what imports this song?OPHELIA. Say you? Nay, pray you mark. [_Sings._] He is dead and gone,lady, He is dead and gone, At his head a grass green turf, At his heelsa stone.QUEEN. Nay, but Opheliaâ€”OPHELIA. Pray you mark. [_Sings._] White his shroud as the mountainsnow. Enter King.QUEEN. Alas, look here, my lord!OPHELIA. [_Sings._] Larded all with sweet flowers; Which bewept to thegrave did go With true-love showers.KING. How do you, pretty lady?OPHELIA. Well, God dild you! They say the owl was a bakerâ€™s daughter.Lord, we know what we are, but know not what we may be. God be at yourtable!KING. Conceit upon her father.OPHELIA. Pray you, letâ€™s have no words of this; but when they ask youwhat it means, say you this: [_Sings._] Tomorrow is Saint Valentineâ€™sday, All in the morning betime, And I a maid at your window, To be yourValentine. Then up he rose and donnâ€™d his clothes, And duppâ€™d the chamber door, Let in the maid, that out a maid Never departed more.KING. Pretty Ophelia!OPHELIA. Indeed la, without an oath, Iâ€™ll make an end onâ€™t. [_Sings._]By Gis and by Saint Charity, Alack, and fie for shame! Young men willdoâ€™t if they come toâ€™t; By Cock, they are to blame. Quoth she, before you tumbled me, You promisâ€™d me to wed. So would I haâ€™ done, by yonder sun, An thou hadst not come to my bed.KING. How long hath she been thus?OPHELIA. I hope all will be well. We must be patient. But I cannotchoose but weep, to think they would lay him iâ€™ thâ€™ cold ground. Mybrother shall know of it. And so I thank you for your good counsel.Come, my coach! Good night, ladies; good night, sweet ladies; goodnight, good night. [_Exit._]KING. Follow her close; give her good watch, I pray you. [_Exit Horatio._]O, this is the poison of deep grief; it springs All from her fatherâ€™sdeath. O Gertrude, Gertrude, When sorrows come, they come not singlespies, But in battalions. First, her father slain; Next, your son gone;and he most violent author Of his own just remove; the people muddied,Thick and and unwholesome in their thoughts and whispers For goodPoloniusâ€™ death; and we have done but greenly In hugger-mugger to interhim. Poor Ophelia Divided from herself and her fair judgment, Withoutthe which we are pictures or mere beasts. Last, and as much containingas all these, Her brother is in secret come from France, Feeds on hiswonder, keeps himself in clouds, And wants not buzzers to infect hisear With pestilent speeches of his fatherâ€™s death, Wherein necessity,of matter beggarâ€™d, Will nothing stick our person to arraign In ear andear. O my dear Gertrude, this, Like to a murdering piece, in manyplaces Gives me superfluous death. [_A noise within._]QUEEN. Alack, what noise is this?KING. Where are my Switzers? Let them guard the door. Enter a Gentleman.What is the matter?GENTLEMAN. Save yourself, my lord. The ocean, overpeering of his list,Eats not the flats with more impetuous haste Than young Laertes, in ariotous head, Oâ€™erbears your offices. The rabble call him lord, And, asthe world were now but to begin, Antiquity forgot, custom not known,The ratifiers and props of every word, They cry â€˜Choose we! Laertesshall be king!â€™ Caps, hands, and tongues applaud it to the clouds,â€˜Laertes shall be king, Laertes king.â€™QUEEN. How cheerfully on the false trail they cry. O, this is counter,you false Danish dogs. [_A noise within._]KING. The doors are broke. Enter Laertes, armed; Danes following.LAERTES. Where is this king?â€”Sirs, stand you all without.Danes. No, letâ€™s come in.LAERTES. I pray you, give me leave.DANES. We will, we will. [_They retire without the door._]LAERTES. I thank you. Keep the door. O thou vile king, Give me myfather.QUEEN. Calmly, good Laertes.LAERTES. That drop of blood thatâ€™s calm proclaims me bastard; Criescuckold to my father, brands the harlot Even here between the chasteunsmirched brow Of my true mother.KING. What is the cause, Laertes, That thy rebellion looks sogiant-like?â€” Let him go, Gertrude. Do not fear our person. Thereâ€™s suchdivinity doth hedge a king, That treason can but peep to what it would,Acts little of his will.â€”Tell me, Laertes, Why thou art thusincensâ€™d.â€”Let him go, Gertrude:â€” Speak, man.LAERTES. Where is my father?KING. Dead.QUEEN. But not by him.KING. Let him demand his fill.LAERTES. How came he dead? Iâ€™ll not be juggled with. To hell,allegiance! Vows, to the blackest devil! Conscience and grace, to theprofoundest pit! I dare damnation. To this point I stand, That both theworlds, I give to negligence, Let come what comes; only Iâ€™ll berevengâ€™d Most throughly for my father.KING. Who shall stay you?LAERTES. My will, not all the world. And for my means, Iâ€™ll husbandthem so well, They shall go far with little.KING. Good Laertes, If you desire to know the certainty Of your dearfatherâ€™s death, isâ€™t writ in your revenge That, sweepstake, you willdraw both friend and foe, Winner and loser?LAERTES. None but his enemies.KING. Will you know them then?LAERTES. To his good friends thus wide Iâ€™ll ope my arms; And, like thekind life-rendering pelican, Repast them with my blood.KING. Why, now you speak Like a good child and a true gentleman. That Iam guiltless of your fatherâ€™s death, And am most sensibly in grief forit, It shall as level to your judgment â€™pear As day does to your eye.DANES. [_Within._] Let her come in.LAERTES. How now! What noise is that? Re-enter Ophelia, fantastically dressed with straws and flowers.O heat, dry up my brains. Tears seven times salt, Burn out the senseand virtue of mine eye. By heaven, thy madness shall be paid by weight,Till our scale turn the beam. O rose of May! Dear maid, kind sister,sweet Ophelia! O heavens, isâ€™t possible a young maidâ€™s wits Should beas mortal as an old manâ€™s life? Nature is fine in love, and where â€™tisfine, It sends some precious instance of itself After the thing itloves.OPHELIA. [_Sings._] They bore him barefacâ€™d on the bier, Hey no nonny,nonny, hey nonny And on his grave rainâ€™d many a tear.â€” Fare you well,my dove!LAERTES. Hadst thou thy wits, and didst persuade revenge, It could notmove thus.OPHELIA. You must sing â€˜Down a-down, and you call him a-down-a.â€™ O, howthe wheel becomes it! It is the false steward that stole his masterâ€™sdaughter.LAERTES. This nothingâ€™s more than matter.OPHELIA. Thereâ€™s rosemary, thatâ€™s for remembrance; pray love, remember.And there is pansies, thatâ€™s for thoughts.LAERTES. A document in madness, thoughts and remembrance fitted.OPHELIA. Thereâ€™s fennel for you, and columbines. Thereâ€™s rue for you;and hereâ€™s some for me. We may call it herb of grace oâ€™ Sundays. O youmust wear your rue with a difference. Thereâ€™s a daisy. I would give yousome violets, but they witherâ€™d all when my father died. They say hemade a good end. [_Sings._] For bonny sweet Robin is all my joy.LAERTES. Thought and affliction, passion, hell itself She turns tofavour and to prettiness.OPHELIA. [_Sings._] And will he not come again? And will he not comeagain? No, no, he is dead, Go to thy death-bed, He never will comeagain. His beard was as white as snow, All flaxen was his poll. He is gone, he is gone, And we cast away moan. God haâ€™ mercy on his soul.And of all Christian souls, I pray God. God bâ€™ wiâ€™ ye. [_Exit._]LAERTES. Do you see this, O God?KING. Laertes, I must commune with your grief, Or you deny me right. Gobut apart, Make choice of whom your wisest friends you will, And theyshall hear and judge â€™twixt you and me. If by direct or by collateralhand They find us touchâ€™d, we will our kingdom give, Our crown, ourlife, and all that we call ours To you in satisfaction; but if not, Beyou content to lend your patience to us, And we shall jointly labourwith your soul To give it due content.LAERTES. Let this be so; His means of death, his obscure burial,â€” Notrophy, sword, nor hatchment oâ€™er his bones, No noble rite, nor formalostentation,â€” Cry to be heard, as â€™twere from heaven to earth, That Imust callâ€™t in question.KING. So you shall. And where thâ€™offence is let the great axe fall. Ipray you go with me. [_Exeunt._]SCENE VI. Another room in the Castle. Enter Horatio and a Servant.HORATIO. What are they that would speak with me?SERVANT. Sailors, sir. They say they have letters for you.HORATIO. Let them come in. [_Exit Servant._]I do not know from what part of the world I should be greeted, if notfrom Lord Hamlet. Enter Sailors.FIRST SAILOR. God bless you, sir.HORATIO. Let him bless thee too.FIRST SAILOR. He shall, sir, andâ€™t please him. Thereâ€™s a letter foryou, sir. It comes from thâ€™ambassador that was bound for England; ifyour name be Horatio, as I am let to know it is.HORATIO. [_Reads._] â€˜Horatio, when thou shalt have overlooked this,give these fellows some means to the King. They have letters for him.Ere we were two days old at sea, a pirate of very warlike appointmentgave us chase. Finding ourselves too slow of sail, we put on acompelled valour, and in the grapple I boarded them. On the instantthey got clear of our ship, so I alone became their prisoner. They havedealt with me like thieves of mercy. But they knew what they did; I amto do a good turn for them. Let the King have the letters I have sent,and repair thou to me with as much haste as thou wouldst fly death. Ihave words to speak in thine ear will make thee dumb; yet are they muchtoo light for the bore of the matter. These good fellows will bringthee where I am. Rosencrantz and Guildenstern hold their course forEngland: of them I have much to tell thee. Farewell. He that thouknowest thine, HAMLET.â€™Come, I will give you way for these your letters, And doâ€™t thespeedier, that you may direct me To him from whom you brought them. [_Exeunt._]SCENE VII. Another room in the Castle. Enter King and Laertes.KING. Now must your conscience my acquittance seal, And you must put mein your heart for friend, Sith you have heard, and with a knowing ear,That he which hath your noble father slain Pursuâ€™d my life.LAERTES. It well appears. But tell me Why you proceeded not againstthese feats, So crimeful and so capital in nature, As by your safety,wisdom, all things else, You mainly were stirrâ€™d up.KING. O, for two special reasons, Which may to you, perhaps, seem muchunsinewâ€™d, But yet to me they are strong. The Queen his mother Livesalmost by his looks; and for myself,â€” My virtue or my plague, be iteither which,â€” Sheâ€™s so conjunctive to my life and soul, That, as thestar moves not but in his sphere, I could not but by her. The othermotive, Why to a public count I might not go, Is the great love thegeneral gender bear him, Who, dipping all his faults in theiraffection, Would like the spring that turneth wood to stone, Converthis gyves to graces; so that my arrows, Too slightly timberâ€™d for soloud a wind, Would have reverted to my bow again, And not where I hadaimâ€™d them.LAERTES. And so have I a noble father lost, A sister driven intodesperate terms, Whose worth, if praises may go back again, Stoodchallenger on mount of all the age For her perfections. But my revengewill come.KING. Break not your sleeps for that. You must not think That we aremade of stuff so flat and dull That we can let our beard be shook withdanger, And think it pastime. You shortly shall hear more. I lovâ€™d yourfather, and we love ourself, And that, I hope, will teach you toimagineâ€” Enter a Messenger.How now? What news?MESSENGER. Letters, my lord, from Hamlet. This to your Majesty; this tothe Queen.KING. From Hamlet! Who brought them?MESSENGER. Sailors, my lord, they say; I saw them not. They were givenme by Claudio. He receivâ€™d them Of him that brought them.KING. Laertes, you shall hear them. Leave us. [_Exit Messenger._][_Reads._] â€˜High and mighty, you shall know I am set naked on yourkingdom. Tomorrow shall I beg leave to see your kingly eyes. When Ishall, first asking your pardon thereunto, recount the occasions of mysudden and more strange return. HAMLET.â€™What should this mean? Are all the rest come back? Or is it some abuse,and no such thing?LAERTES. Know you the hand?KING. â€™Tis Hamletâ€™s character. â€™Naked!â€™ And in a postscript here hesays â€˜alone.â€™ Can you advise me?LAERTES. I am lost in it, my lord. But let him come, It warms the verysickness in my heart That I shall live and tell him to his teeth, â€˜Thusdiest thou.â€™KING. If it be so, Laertes,â€” As how should it be so? How otherwise?â€”Will you be rulâ€™d by me?LAERTES. Ay, my lord; So you will not oâ€™errule me to a peace.KING. To thine own peace. If he be now returnâ€™d, As checking at hisvoyage, and that he means No more to undertake it, I will work him Toexploit, now ripe in my device, Under the which he shall not choose butfall; And for his death no wind shall breathe, But even his mothershall uncharge the practice And call it accident.LAERTES. My lord, I will be rulâ€™d; The rather if you could devise it soThat I might be the organ.KING. It falls right. You have been talkâ€™d of since your travel much,And that in Hamletâ€™s hearing, for a quality Wherein they say you shine.Your sum of parts Did not together pluck such envy from him As did thatone, and that, in my regard, Of the unworthiest siege.LAERTES. What part is that, my lord?KING. A very riband in the cap of youth, Yet needful too, for youth noless becomes The light and careless livery that it wears Than settledage his sables and his weeds, Importing health and graveness. Twomonths since Here was a gentleman of Normandy,â€” Iâ€™ve seen myself, andservâ€™d against, the French, And they can well on horseback, but thisgallant Had witchcraft inâ€™t. He grew unto his seat, And to suchwondrous doing brought his horse, As had he been incorpsâ€™d anddemi-naturâ€™d With the brave beast. So far he toppâ€™d my thought That Iin forgery of shapes and tricks, Come short of what he did.LAERTES. A Norman wasâ€™t?KING. A Norman.LAERTES. Upon my life, Lamond.KING. The very same.LAERTES. I know him well. He is the brooch indeed And gem of all thenation.KING. He made confession of you, And gave you such a masterly reportFor art and exercise in your defence, And for your rapier mostespecially, That he cried out â€™twould be a sight indeed If one couldmatch you. The scrimers of their nation He swore had neither motion,guard, nor eye, If you opposâ€™d them. Sir, this report of his Did Hamletso envenom with his envy That he could nothing do but wish and beg Yoursudden coming oâ€™er to play with him. Now, out of this,â€”LAERTES. What out of this, my lord?KING. Laertes, was your father dear to you? Or are you like thepainting of a sorrow, A face without a heart?LAERTES. Why ask you this?KING. Not that I think you did not love your father, But that I knowlove is begun by time, And that I see, in passages of proof, Timequalifies the spark and fire of it. There lives within the very flameof love A kind of wick or snuff that will abate it; And nothing is at alike goodness still, For goodness, growing to a pleurisy, Dies in hisown too much. That we would do, We should do when we would; for thisâ€˜wouldâ€™ changes, And hath abatements and delays as many As there aretongues, are hands, are accidents; And then this â€˜shouldâ€™ is like aspendthrift sigh That hurts by easing. But to the quick oâ€™ thâ€™ulcer:Hamlet comes back: what would you undertake To show yourself yourfatherâ€™s son in deed, More than in words?LAERTES. To cut his throat iâ€™ thâ€™ church.KING. No place, indeed, should murder sanctuarize; Revenge should haveno bounds. But good Laertes, Will you do this, keep close within yourchamber. Hamlet returnâ€™d shall know you are come home: Weâ€™ll put onthose shall praise your excellence, And set a double varnish on thefame The Frenchman gave you, bring you in fine together And wager onyour heads. He, being remiss, Most generous, and free from allcontriving, Will not peruse the foils; so that with ease, Or with alittle shuffling, you may choose A sword unbated, and in a pass ofpractice, Requite him for your father.LAERTES. I will doâ€™t. And for that purpose Iâ€™ll anoint my sword. Ibought an unction of a mountebank So mortal that, but dip a knife init, Where it draws blood no cataplasm so rare, Collected from allsimples that have virtue Under the moon, can save the thing from deathThis is but scratchâ€™d withal. Iâ€™ll touch my point With this contagion,that if I gall him slightly, It may be death.KING. Letâ€™s further think of this, Weigh what convenience both of timeand means May fit us to our shape. If this should fail, And that ourdrift look through our bad performance. â€™Twere better not assayâ€™d.Therefore this project Should have a back or second, that might hold Ifthis did blast in proof. Soft, let me see. Weâ€™ll make a solemn wager onyour cunnings,â€” I haâ€™t! When in your motion you are hot and dry, Asmake your bouts more violent to that end, And that he calls for drink,Iâ€™ll have preparâ€™d him A chalice for the nonce; whereon but sipping, Ifhe by chance escape your venomâ€™d stuck, Our purpose may hold there. Enter Queen.How now, sweet Queen?QUEEN. One woe doth tread upon anotherâ€™s heel, So fast they follow.Your sisterâ€™s drownâ€™d, Laertes.LAERTES. Drownâ€™d! O, where?QUEEN. There is a willow grows aslant a brook, That shows his hoaryleaves in the glassy stream. There with fantastic garlands did she makeOf crow-flowers, nettles, daisies, and long purples, That liberalshepherds give a grosser name, But our cold maids do dead menâ€™s fingerscall them. There on the pendant boughs her coronet weeds Clambâ€™ring tohang, an envious sliver broke, When down her weedy trophies and herselfFell in the weeping brook. Her clothes spread wide, And mermaid-like,awhile they bore her up, Which time she chaunted snatches of old tunes,As one incapable of her own distress, Or like a creature native andindued Unto that element. But long it could not be Till that hergarments, heavy with their drink, Pullâ€™d the poor wretch from hermelodious lay To muddy death.LAERTES. Alas, then she is drownâ€™d?QUEEN. Drownâ€™d, drownâ€™d.LAERTES. Too much of water hast thou, poor Ophelia, And therefore Iforbid my tears. But yet It is our trick; nature her custom holds, Letshame say what it will. When these are gone, The woman will be out.Adieu, my lord, I have a speech of fire, that fain would blaze, Butthat this folly douts it. [_Exit._]KING. Letâ€™s follow, Gertrude; How much I had to do to calm his rage!Now fear I this will give it start again; Therefore letâ€™s follow. [_Exeunt._]ACT VSCENE I. A churchyard. Enter two Clowns with spades, &amp;c.FIRST CLOWN. Is she to be buried in Christian burial, when she wilfullyseeks her own salvation?SECOND CLOWN. I tell thee she is, and therefore make her gravestraight. The crowner hath sat on her, and finds it Christian burial.FIRST CLOWN. How can that be, unless she drowned herself in her owndefence?SECOND CLOWN. Why, â€™tis found so.FIRST CLOWN. It must be _se offendendo_, it cannot be else. For herelies the point: if I drown myself wittingly, it argues an act: and anact hath three branches. It is to act, to do, and to perform: argal,she drowned herself wittingly.SECOND CLOWN. Nay, but hear you, goodman delver,â€”FIRST CLOWN. Give me leave. Here lies the water; good. Here stands theman; good. If the man go to this water and drown himself, it is, willhe nill he, he goes,â€”mark you that. But if the water come to him anddrown him, he drowns not himself. Argal, he that is not guilty of hisown death shortens not his own life.SECOND CLOWN. But is this law?FIRST CLOWN. Ay, marry, isâ€™t, crownerâ€™s quest law.SECOND CLOWN. Will you haâ€™ the truth onâ€™t? If this had not been agentlewoman, she should have been buried out oâ€™ Christian burial.FIRST CLOWN. Why, there thou sayâ€™st. And the more pity that great folkshould have countenance in this world to drown or hang themselves morethan their even Christian. Come, my spade. There is no ancientgentlemen but gardeners, ditchers, and grave-makers: they hold upAdamâ€™s profession.SECOND CLOWN. Was he a gentleman?FIRST CLOWN. He was the first that ever bore arms.SECOND CLOWN. Why, he had none.FIRST CLOWN. What, art a heathen? How dost thou understand theScripture? The Scripture says Adam diggâ€™d. Could he dig without arms?Iâ€™ll put another question to thee. If thou answerest me not to thepurpose, confess thyselfâ€”SECOND CLOWN. Go to.FIRST CLOWN. What is he that builds stronger than either the mason, theshipwright, or the carpenter?SECOND CLOWN. The gallows-maker; for that frame outlives a thousandtenants.FIRST CLOWN. I like thy wit well in good faith, the gallows does well.But how does it well? It does well to those that do ill. Now, thou dostill to say the gallows is built stronger than the church; argal, thegallows may do well to thee. Toâ€™t again, come.SECOND CLOWN. Who builds stronger than a mason, a shipwright, or acarpenter?FIRST CLOWN. Ay, tell me that, and unyoke.SECOND CLOWN. Marry, now I can tell.FIRST CLOWN. Toâ€™t.SECOND CLOWN. Mass, I cannot tell. Enter Hamlet and Horatio, at a distance.FIRST CLOWN. Cudgel thy brains no more about it, for your dull ass willnot mend his pace with beating; and when you are asked this questionnext, say â€˜a grave-makerâ€™. The houses he makes last till doomsday. Go,get thee to Yaughan; fetch me a stoup of liquor. [_Exit Second Clown._][_Digs and sings._] In youth when I did love, did love, Methought it was very sweet; To contract, O, the time for, a, my behove, O methought there was nothing meet.HAMLET. Has this fellow no feeling of his business, that he sings atgrave-making?HORATIO. Custom hath made it in him a property of easiness.HAMLET. â€™Tis eâ€™en so; the hand of little employment hath the daintiersense.FIRST CLOWN. [_Sings._] But age with his stealing steps Hath clawâ€™d mein his clutch, And hath shippâ€™d me into the land, As if I had neverbeen such. [_Throws up a skull._]HAMLET. That skull had a tongue in it, and could sing once. How theknave jowls it to thâ€™ ground, as if â€™twere Cainâ€™s jawbone, that did thefirst murder! This might be the pate of a politician which this ass nowoâ€™er-offices, one that would circumvent God, might it not?HORATIO. It might, my lord.HAMLET. Or of a courtier, which could say â€˜Good morrow, sweet lord! Howdost thou, good lord?â€™ This might be my lord such-a-one, that praisedmy lord such-a-oneâ€™s horse when he meant to beg it, might it not?HORATIO. Ay, my lord.HAMLET. Why, eâ€™en so: and now my Lady Wormâ€™s; chapless, and knockedabout the mazard with a sextonâ€™s spade. Hereâ€™s fine revolution, an wehad the trick to seeâ€™t. Did these bones cost no more the breeding butto play at loggets with â€™em? Mine ache to think onâ€™t.FIRST CLOWN. [_Sings._] A pickaxe and a spade, a spade, For and ashrouding-sheet; O, a pit of clay for to be made For such a guest ismeet. [_Throws up another skull._]HAMLET. Thereâ€™s another. Why may not that be the skull of a lawyer?Where be his quiddits now, his quillets, his cases, his tenures, andhis tricks? Why does he suffer this rude knave now to knock him aboutthe sconce with a dirty shovel, and will not tell him of his action ofbattery? Hum. This fellow might be inâ€™s time a great buyer of land,with his statutes, his recognizances, his fines, his double vouchers,his recoveries. Is this the fine of his fines, and the recovery of hisrecoveries, to have his fine pate full of fine dirt? Will his vouchersvouch him no more of his purchases, and double ones too, than thelength and breadth of a pair of indentures? The very conveyances of hislands will scarcely lie in this box; and must the inheritor himselfhave no more, ha?HORATIO. Not a jot more, my lord.HAMLET. Is not parchment made of sheep-skins?HORATIO. Ay, my lord, and of calf-skins too.HAMLET. They are sheep and calves which seek out assurance in that. Iwill speak to this fellow.â€”Whose graveâ€™s this, sir?FIRST CLOWN. Mine, sir. [_Sings._] O, a pit of clay for to be made Forsuch a guest is meet.HAMLET. I think it be thine indeed, for thou liest inâ€™t.FIRST CLOWN. You lie out onâ€™t, sir, and therefore â€™tis not yours. Formy part, I do not lie inâ€™t, yet it is mine.HAMLET. Thou dost lie inâ€™t, to be inâ€™t and say it is thine. â€™Tis forthe dead, not for the quick; therefore thou liest.FIRST CLOWN. â€™Tis a quick lie, sir; â€™t will away again from me to you.HAMLET. What man dost thou dig it for?FIRST CLOWN. For no man, sir.HAMLET. What woman then?FIRST CLOWN. For none neither.HAMLET. Who is to be buried inâ€™t?FIRST CLOWN. One that was a woman, sir; but, rest her soul, sheâ€™s dead.HAMLET. How absolute the knave is! We must speak by the card, orequivocation will undo us. By the Lord, Horatio, these three years Ihave taken note of it, the age is grown so picked that the toe of thepeasant comes so near the heel of the courtier he galls his kibe.â€”Howlong hast thou been a grave-maker?FIRST CLOWN. Of all the days iâ€™ thâ€™ year, I came toâ€™t that day that ourlast King Hamlet oâ€™ercame Fortinbras.HAMLET. How long is that since?FIRST CLOWN. Cannot you tell that? Every fool can tell that. It was thevery day that young Hamlet was born,â€”he that is mad, and sent intoEngland.HAMLET. Ay, marry, why was he sent into England?FIRST CLOWN. Why, because he was mad; he shall recover his wits there;or if he do not, itâ€™s no great matter there.HAMLET. Why?FIRST CLOWN. â€™Twill not be seen in him there; there the men are as madas he.HAMLET. How came he mad?FIRST CLOWN. Very strangely, they say.HAMLET. How strangely?FIRST CLOWN. Faith, eâ€™en with losing his wits.HAMLET. Upon what ground?FIRST CLOWN. Why, here in Denmark. I have been sexton here, man andboy, thirty years.HAMLET. How long will a man lie iâ€™ thâ€™earth ere he rot?FIRST CLOWN. Faith, if he be not rotten before he die,â€”as we have manypocky corses nowadays that will scarce hold the laying in,â€”he will lastyou some eight year or nine year. A tanner will last you nine year.HAMLET. Why he more than another?FIRST CLOWN. Why, sir, his hide is so tannâ€™d with his trade that hewill keep out water a great while. And your water is a sore decayer ofyour whoreson dead body. Hereâ€™s a skull now; this skull hath lain inthe earth three-and-twenty years.HAMLET. Whose was it?FIRST CLOWN. A whoreson, mad fellowâ€™s it was. Whose do you think itwas?HAMLET. Nay, I know not.FIRST CLOWN. A pestilence on him for a mad rogue! A pourâ€™d a flagon ofRhenish on my head once. This same skull, sir, was Yorickâ€™s skull, theKingâ€™s jester.HAMLET. This?FIRST CLOWN. Eâ€™en that.HAMLET. Let me see. [_Takes the skull._] Alas, poor Yorick. I knew him,Horatio, a fellow of infinite jest, of most excellent fancy. He hathborne me on his back a thousand times; and now, how abhorred in myimagination it is! My gorge rises at it. Here hung those lips that Ihave kissâ€™d I know not how oft. Where be your gibes now? your gambols?your songs? your flashes of merriment, that were wont to set the tableon a roar? Not one now, to mock your own grinning? Quite chop-fallen?Now get you to my ladyâ€™s chamber, and tell her, let her paint an inchthick, to this favour she must come. Make her laugh at that.â€”Prythee,Horatio, tell me one thing.HORATIO. Whatâ€™s that, my lord?HAMLET. Dost thou think Alexander looked oâ€™ this fashion iâ€™ thâ€™earth?HORATIO. Eâ€™en so.HAMLET. And smelt so? Pah! [_Throws down the skull._]HORATIO. Eâ€™en so, my lord.HAMLET. To what base uses we may return, Horatio! Why may notimagination trace the noble dust of Alexander till he find it stoppinga bung-hole?HORATIO. â€™Twere to consider too curiously to consider so.HAMLET. No, faith, not a jot. But to follow him thither with modestyenough, and likelihood to lead it; as thus. Alexander died, Alexanderwas buried, Alexander returneth into dust; the dust is earth; of earthwe make loam; and why of that loam whereto he was converted might theynot stop a beer-barrel? Imperious Caesar, dead and turnâ€™d to clay,Might stop a hole to keep the wind away. O, that that earth which keptthe world in awe Should patch a wall tâ€™expel the winterâ€™s flaw. Butsoft! but soft! aside! Here comes the King. Enter priests, &amp;c, in procession; the corpse of Ophelia, Laertes and Mourners following; King, Queen, their Trains, &amp;c.The Queen, the courtiers. Who is that they follow? And with such maimedrites? This doth betoken The corse they follow did with desperate handFordo it own life. â€™Twas of some estate. Couch we awhile and mark. [_Retiring with Horatio._]LAERTES. What ceremony else?HAMLET. That is Laertes, a very noble youth. Mark.LAERTES. What ceremony else?PRIEST. Her obsequies have been as far enlargâ€™d As we have warranties.Her death was doubtful; And but that great command oâ€™ersways the order,She should in ground unsanctified have lodgâ€™d Till the last trumpet.For charitable prayers, Shards, flints, and pebbles should be thrown onher. Yet here she is allowed her virgin rites, Her maiden strewments,and the bringing home Of bell and burial.LAERTES. Must there no more be done?PRIEST. No more be done. We should profane the service of the dead Tosing sage requiem and such rest to her As to peace-parted souls.LAERTES. Lay her iâ€™ thâ€™earth, And from her fair and unpolluted fleshMay violets spring. I tell thee, churlish priest, A ministâ€™ring angelshall my sister be When thou liest howling.HAMLET. What, the fair Ophelia?QUEEN. [_Scattering flowers._] Sweets to the sweet. Farewell. I hopâ€™dthou shouldst have been my Hamletâ€™s wife; I thought thy bride-bed tohave deckâ€™d, sweet maid, And not have strewâ€™d thy grave.LAERTES. O, treble woe Fall ten times treble on that cursed head Whosewicked deed thy most ingenious sense Deprivâ€™d thee of. Hold off theearth a while, Till I have caught her once more in mine arms. [_Leapsinto the grave._] Now pile your dust upon the quick and dead, Till ofthis flat a mountain you have made, To oâ€™ertop old Pelion or the skyishhead Of blue Olympus.HAMLET. [_Advancing._] What is he whose grief Bears such an emphasis?whose phrase of sorrow Conjures the wandâ€™ring stars, and makes themstand Like wonder-wounded hearers? This is I, Hamlet the Dane. [_Leapsinto the grave._]LAERTES. [_Grappling with him._] The devil take thy soul!HAMLET. Thou prayâ€™st not well. I prythee take thy fingers from mythroat; For though I am not splenative and rash, Yet have I in mesomething dangerous, Which let thy wiseness fear. Away thy hand!KING. Pluck them asunder.QUEEN. Hamlet! Hamlet!All. Gentlemen!HORATIO. Good my lord, be quiet. [_The Attendants part them, and they come out of the grave._]HAMLET. Why, I will fight with him upon this theme Until my eyelidswill no longer wag.QUEEN. O my son, what theme?HAMLET. I lovâ€™d Ophelia; forty thousand brothers Could not, with alltheir quantity of love, Make up my sum. What wilt thou do for her?KING. O, he is mad, Laertes.QUEEN. For love of God forbear him!HAMLET. â€™Swounds, show me what thouâ€™lt do: Woulâ€™t weep? woulâ€™t fight?woulâ€™t fast? woulâ€™t tear thyself? Woulâ€™t drink up eisel? eat acrocodile? Iâ€™ll doâ€™t. Dost thou come here to whine? To outface me withleaping in her grave? Be buried quick with her, and so will I. And ifthou prate of mountains, let them throw Millions of acres on us, tillour ground, Singeing his pate against the burning zone, Make Ossa likea wart. Nay, an thouâ€™lt mouth, Iâ€™ll rant as well as thou.QUEEN. This is mere madness: And thus awhile the fit will work on him;Anon, as patient as the female dove, When that her golden couplets aredisclosâ€™d, His silence will sit drooping.HAMLET. Hear you, sir; What is the reason that you use me thus? I lovâ€™dyou ever. But it is no matter. Let Hercules himself do what he may, Thecat will mew, and dog will have his day. [_Exit._]KING. I pray thee, good Horatio, wait upon him. [_Exit Horatio._][_To Laertes_] Strengthen your patience in our last nightâ€™s speech;Weâ€™ll put the matter to the present push.â€” Good Gertrude, set somewatch over your son. This grave shall have a living monument. An hourof quiet shortly shall we see; Till then in patience our proceeding be. [_Exeunt._]SCENE II. A hall in the Castle. Enter Hamlet and Horatio.HAMLET. So much for this, sir. Now let me see the other; You doremember all the circumstance?HORATIO. Remember it, my lord!HAMLET. Sir, in my heart there was a kind of fighting That would notlet me sleep. Methought I lay Worse than the mutinies in the bilboes.Rashly, And praisâ€™d be rashness for it,â€”let us know, Our indiscretionsometime serves us well, When our deep plots do pall; and that shouldteach us Thereâ€™s a divinity that shapes our ends, Rough-hew them how wewill.HORATIO. That is most certain.HAMLET. Up from my cabin, My sea-gown scarfâ€™d about me, in the darkGropâ€™d I to find out them; had my desire, Fingerâ€™d their packet, and infine, withdrew To mine own room again, making so bold, My fearsforgetting manners, to unseal Their grand commission; where I found,Horatio, Oh royal knavery! an exact command, Larded with many severalsorts of reasons, Importing Denmarkâ€™s health, and Englandâ€™s too, Withho! such bugs and goblins in my life, That on the supervise, no leisurebated, No, not to stay the grinding of the axe, My head should bestruck off.HORATIO. Isâ€™t possible?HAMLET. Hereâ€™s the commission, read it at more leisure. But wilt thouhear me how I did proceed?HORATIO. I beseech you.HAMLET. Being thus benetted round with villanies,â€” Or I could make aprologue to my brains, They had begun the play,â€”I sat me down, Devisâ€™da new commission, wrote it fair: I once did hold it, as our statistsdo, A baseness to write fair, and labourâ€™d much How to forget thatlearning; but, sir, now It did me yeomanâ€™s service. Wilt thou know Theeffect of what I wrote?HORATIO. Ay, good my lord.HAMLET. An earnest conjuration from the King, As England was hisfaithful tributary, As love between them like the palm might flourish,As peace should still her wheaten garland wear And stand a comma â€™tweentheir amities, And many such-like â€˜asâ€™es of great charge, That on theview and know of these contents, Without debatement further, more orless, He should the bearers put to sudden death, Not shriving-timeallowâ€™d.HORATIO. How was this sealâ€™d?HAMLET. Why, even in that was heaven ordinant. I had my fatherâ€™s signetin my purse, Which was the model of that Danish seal: Folded the writup in the form of the other, Subscribâ€™d it: gaveâ€™t thâ€™impression;placâ€™d it safely, The changeling never known. Now, the next day Was oursea-fight, and what to this was sequent Thou knowâ€™st already.HORATIO. So Guildenstern and Rosencrantz go toâ€™t.HAMLET. Why, man, they did make love to this employment. They are notnear my conscience; their defeat Does by their own insinuation grow.â€™Tis dangerous when the baser nature comes Between the pass and fellincensed points Of mighty opposites.HORATIO. Why, what a king is this!HAMLET. Does it not, thinksâ€™t thee, stand me now upon,â€” He that hathkillâ€™d my king, and whorâ€™d my mother, Poppâ€™d in between thâ€™election andmy hopes, Thrown out his angle for my proper life, And with suchcozenageâ€”isâ€™t not perfect conscience To quit him with this arm? Andisâ€™t not to be damnâ€™d To let this canker of our nature come In furtherevil?HORATIO. It must be shortly known to him from England What is the issueof the business there.HAMLET. It will be short. The interim is mine; And a manâ€™s lifeâ€™s nomore than to say â€˜Oneâ€™. But I am very sorry, good Horatio, That toLaertes I forgot myself; For by the image of my cause I see Theportraiture of his. Iâ€™ll court his favours. But sure the bravery of hisgrief did put me Into a towâ€™ring passion.HORATIO. Peace, who comes here? Enter Osric.OSRIC. Your lordship is right welcome back to Denmark.HAMLET. I humbly thank you, sir. Dost know this waterfly?HORATIO. No, my good lord.HAMLET. Thy state is the more gracious; for â€™tis a vice to know him. Hehath much land, and fertile; let a beast be lord of beasts, and hiscrib shall stand at the kingâ€™s mess; â€™tis a chough; but, as I say,spacious in the possession of dirt.OSRIC. Sweet lord, if your lordship were at leisure, I should impart athing to you from his Majesty.HAMLET. I will receive it with all diligence of spirit. Put your bonnetto his right use; â€™tis for the head.OSRIC. I thank your lordship, â€™tis very hot.HAMLET. No, believe me, â€™tis very cold, the wind is northerly.OSRIC. It is indifferent cold, my lord, indeed.HAMLET. Methinks it is very sultry and hot for my complexion.OSRIC. Exceedingly, my lord; it is very sultry,â€”as â€™twereâ€”I cannot tellhow. But, my lord, his Majesty bade me signify to you that he has laida great wager on your head. Sir, this is the matter,â€”HAMLET. I beseech you, remember,â€” [_Hamlet moves him to put on his hat._]OSRIC. Nay, in good faith; for mine ease, in good faith. Sir, here isnewly come to court Laertes; believe me, an absolute gentleman, full ofmost excellent differences, of very soft society and great showing.Indeed, to speak feelingly of him, he is the card or calendar ofgentry; for you shall find in him the continent of what part agentleman would see.HAMLET. Sir, his definement suffers no perdition in you, though I know,to divide him inventorially would dizzy thâ€™arithmetic of memory, andyet but yaw neither, in respect of his quick sail. But, in the verityof extolment, I take him to be a soul of great article and his infusionof such dearth and rareness as, to make true diction of him, hissemblable is his mirror and who else would trace him his umbrage,nothing more.OSRIC. Your lordship speaks most infallibly of him.HAMLET. The concernancy, sir? Why do we wrap the gentleman in our morerawer breath?OSRIC. Sir?HORATIO. Isâ€™t not possible to understand in another tongue? You willdoâ€™t, sir, really.HAMLET. What imports the nomination of this gentleman?OSRIC. Of Laertes?HORATIO. His purse is empty already, allâ€™s golden words are spent.HAMLET. Of him, sir.OSRIC. I know you are not ignorant,â€”HAMLET. I would you did, sir; yet in faith if you did, it would notmuch approve me. Well, sir?OSRIC. You are not ignorant of what excellence Laertes is,â€”HAMLET. I dare not confess that, lest I should compare with him inexcellence; but to know a man well were to know himself.OSRIC. I mean, sir, for his weapon; but in the imputation laid on him,by them in his meed heâ€™s unfellowed.HAMLET. Whatâ€™s his weapon?OSRIC. Rapier and dagger.HAMLET. Thatâ€™s two of his weapons. But well.OSRIC. The King, sir, hath wagerâ€™d with him six Barbary horses, againstthe which he has imponed, as I take it, six French rapiers andponiards, with their assigns, as girdle, hangers, and so. Three of thecarriages, in faith, are very dear to fancy, very responsive to thehilts, most delicate carriages, and of very liberal conceit.HAMLET. What call you the carriages?HORATIO. I knew you must be edified by the margin ere you had done.OSRIC. The carriages, sir, are the hangers.HAMLET. The phrase would be more german to the matter if we could carrycannon by our sides. I would it might be hangers till then. But on. SixBarbary horses against six French swords, their assigns, and threeliberal conceited carriages: thatâ€™s the French bet against the Danish.Why is this all imponed, as you call it?OSRIC. The King, sir, hath laid that in a dozen passes between you andhim, he shall not exceed you three hits. He hath laid on twelve fornine. And it would come to immediate trial if your lordship wouldvouchsafe the answer.HAMLET. How if I answer no?OSRIC. I mean, my lord, the opposition of your person in trial.HAMLET. Sir, I will walk here in the hall. If it please his Majesty, itis the breathing time of day with me. Let the foils be brought, thegentleman willing, and the King hold his purpose, I will win for him ifI can; if not, I will gain nothing but my shame and the odd hits.OSRIC. Shall I re-deliver you eâ€™en so?HAMLET. To this effect, sir; after what flourish your nature will.OSRIC. I commend my duty to your lordship.HAMLET. Yours, yours. [_Exit Osric._]He does well to commend it himself, there are no tongues else forâ€™sturn.HORATIO. This lapwing runs away with the shell on his head.HAMLET. He did comply with his dug before he suckâ€™d it. Thus hashe,â€”and many more of the same bevy that I know the drossy age doteson,â€” only got the tune of the time and outward habit of encounter; akind of yeasty collection, which carries them through and through themost fanned and winnowed opinions; and do but blow them to their trial,the bubbles are out, Enter a Lord.LORD. My lord, his Majesty commended him to you by young Osric, whobrings back to him that you attend him in the hall. He sends to know ifyour pleasure hold to play with Laertes or that you will take longertime.HAMLET. I am constant to my purposes, they follow the Kingâ€™s pleasure.If his fitness speaks, mine is ready. Now or whensoever, provided I beso able as now.LORD. The King and Queen and all are coming down.HAMLET. In happy time.LORD. The Queen desires you to use some gentle entertainment to Laertesbefore you fall to play.HAMLET. She well instructs me. [_Exit Lord._]HORATIO. You will lose this wager, my lord.HAMLET. I do not think so. Since he went into France, I have been incontinual practice. I shall win at the odds. But thou wouldst not thinkhow ill allâ€™s here about my heart: but it is no matter.HORATIO. Nay, good my lord.HAMLET. It is but foolery; but it is such a kind of gain-giving aswould perhaps trouble a woman.HORATIO. If your mind dislike anything, obey it. I will forestall theirrepair hither, and say you are not fit.HAMLET. Not a whit, we defy augury. Thereâ€™s a special providence in thefall of a sparrow. If it be now, â€™tis not to come; if it be not tocome, it will be now; if it be not now, yet it will come. The readinessis all. Since no man has aught of what he leaves, what isâ€™t to leavebetimes? Enter King, Queen, Laertes, Lords, Osric and Attendants with foils &amp;c.KING. Come, Hamlet, come, and take this hand from me. [_The King puts Laertesâ€™s hand into Hamletâ€™s._]HAMLET. Give me your pardon, sir. I have done you wrong; But pardonâ€™tas you are a gentleman. This presence knows, and you must needs haveheard, How I am punishâ€™d with sore distraction. What I have done Thatmight your nature, honour, and exception Roughly awake, I here proclaimwas madness. Wasâ€™t Hamlet wrongâ€™d Laertes? Never Hamlet. If Hamlet fromhimself be taâ€™en away, And when heâ€™s not himself does wrong Laertes,Then Hamlet does it not, Hamlet denies it. Who does it, then? Hismadness. Ifâ€™t be so, Hamlet is of the faction that is wrongâ€™d; Hismadness is poor Hamletâ€™s enemy. Sir, in this audience, Let mydisclaiming from a purposâ€™d evil Free me so far in your most generousthoughts That I have shot my arrow oâ€™er the house And hurt my brother.LAERTES. I am satisfied in nature, Whose motive in this case shouldstir me most To my revenge. But in my terms of honour I stand aloof,and will no reconcilement Till by some elder masters of known honour Ihave a voice and precedent of peace To keep my name ungorâ€™d. But tillthat time I do receive your offerâ€™d love like love, And will not wrongit.HAMLET. I embrace it freely, And will this brotherâ€™s wager franklyplay.â€” Give us the foils; come on.LAERTES. Come, one for me.HAMLET. Iâ€™ll be your foil, Laertes; in mine ignorance Your skill shalllike a star iâ€™ thâ€™ darkest night, Stick fiery off indeed.LAERTES. You mock me, sir.HAMLET. No, by this hand.KING. Give them the foils, young Osric. Cousin Hamlet, You know thewager?HAMLET. Very well, my lord. Your Grace has laid the odds oâ€™ the weakerside.KING. I do not fear it. I have seen you both; But since he is betterâ€™d,we have therefore odds.LAERTES. This is too heavy. Let me see another.HAMLET. This likes me well. These foils have all a length? [_They prepare to play._]OSRIC. Ay, my good lord.KING. Set me the stoups of wine upon that table. If Hamlet give thefirst or second hit, Or quit in answer of the third exchange, Let allthe battlements their ordnance fire; The King shall drink to Hamletâ€™sbetter breath, And in the cup an union shall he throw Richer than thatwhich four successive kings In Denmarkâ€™s crown have worn. Give me thecups; And let the kettle to the trumpet speak, The trumpet to thecannoneer without, The cannons to the heavens, the heavens to earth,â€˜Now the King drinks to Hamlet.â€™ Come, begin. And you, the judges, beara wary eye.HAMLET. Come on, sir.LAERTES. Come, my lord. [_They play._]HAMLET. One.LAERTES. No.HAMLET. Judgment.OSRIC. A hit, a very palpable hit.LAERTES. Well; again.KING. Stay, give me drink. Hamlet, this pearl is thine; Hereâ€™s to thyhealth. [_Trumpets sound, and cannon shot off within._]Give him the cup.HAMLET. Iâ€™ll play this bout first; set it by awhile. [_They play._]Come. Another hit; what say you?LAERTES. A touch, a touch, I do confess.KING. Our son shall win.QUEEN. Heâ€™s fat, and scant of breath. Here, Hamlet, take my napkin, rubthy brows. The Queen carouses to thy fortune, Hamlet.HAMLET. Good madam.KING. Gertrude, do not drink.QUEEN. I will, my lord; I pray you pardon me.KING. [_Aside._] It is the poisonâ€™d cup; it is too late.HAMLET. I dare not drink yet, madam. By and by.QUEEN. Come, let me wipe thy face.LAERTES. My lord, Iâ€™ll hit him now.KING. I do not thinkâ€™t.LAERTES. [_Aside._] And yet â€™tis almost â€™gainst my conscience.HAMLET. Come for the third, Laertes. You do but dally. I pray you passwith your best violence. I am afeard you make a wanton of me.LAERTES. Say you so? Come on. [_They play._]OSRIC. Nothing neither way.LAERTES. Have at you now. [_Laertes wounds Hamlet; then, in scuffling, they change rapiers, and Hamlet wounds Laertes._]KING. Part them; they are incensâ€™d.HAMLET. Nay, come again! [_The Queen falls._]OSRIC. Look to the Queen there, ho!HORATIO. They bleed on both sides. How is it, my lord?OSRIC. How isâ€™t, Laertes?LAERTES. Why, as a woodcock to my own springe, Osric. I am justlykillâ€™d with mine own treachery.HAMLET. How does the Queen?KING. She swoons to see them bleed.QUEEN. No, no, the drink, the drink! O my dear Hamlet! The drink, thedrink! I am poisonâ€™d. [_Dies._]HAMLET. O villany! Ho! Let the door be lockâ€™d: Treachery! Seek it out. [_Laertes falls._]LAERTES. It is here, Hamlet. Hamlet, thou art slain. No medicine in theworld can do thee good. In thee there is not half an hour of life; Thetreacherous instrument is in thy hand, Unbated and envenomâ€™d. The foulpractice Hath turnâ€™d itself on me. Lo, here I lie, Never to rise again.Thy motherâ€™s poisonâ€™d. I can no more. The King, the Kingâ€™s to blame.HAMLET. The point envenomâ€™d too! Then, venom, to thy work. [_Stabs the King._]OSRIC and LORDS. Treason! treason!KING. O yet defend me, friends. I am but hurt.HAMLET. Here, thou incestuous, murderous, damned Dane, Drink off thispotion. Is thy union here? Follow my mother. [_King dies._]LAERTES. He is justly servâ€™d. It is a poison temperâ€™d by himself.Exchange forgiveness with me, noble Hamlet. Mine and my fatherâ€™s deathcome not upon thee, Nor thine on me. [_Dies._]HAMLET. Heaven make thee free of it! I follow thee. I am dead, Horatio.Wretched Queen, adieu. You that look pale and tremble at this chance,That are but mutes or audience to this act, Had I but time,â€”as thisfell sergeant, death, Is strict in his arrest,â€”O, I could tell you,â€”But let it be. Horatio, I am dead, Thou livâ€™st; report me and my causearight To the unsatisfied.HORATIO. Never believe it. I am more an antique Roman than a Dane.Hereâ€™s yet some liquor left.HAMLET. As thâ€™art a man, Give me the cup. Let go; by Heaven, Iâ€™llhaveâ€™t. O good Horatio, what a wounded name, Things standing thusunknown, shall live behind me. If thou didst ever hold me in thy heart,Absent thee from felicity awhile, And in this harsh world draw thybreath in pain, To tell my story. [_March afar off, and shot within._]What warlike noise is this?OSRIC. Young Fortinbras, with conquest come from Poland, To theambassadors of England gives This warlike volley.HAMLET. O, I die, Horatio. The potent poison quite oâ€™er-crows myspirit: I cannot live to hear the news from England, But I do prophesythâ€™election lights On Fortinbras. He has my dying voice. So tell him,with the occurrents more and less, Which have solicited. The rest issilence. [_Dies._]HORATIO. Now cracks a noble heart. Good night, sweet prince, Andflights of angels sing thee to thy rest. Why does the drum come hither? [_March within._] Enter Fortinbras, the English Ambassadors and others.FORTINBRAS. Where is this sight?HORATIO. What is it you would see? If aught of woe or wonder, ceaseyour search.FORTINBRAS. This quarry cries on havoc. O proud death, What feast istoward in thine eternal cell, That thou so many princes at a shot Sobloodily hast struck?FIRST AMBASSADOR. The sight is dismal; And our affairs from Englandcome too late. The ears are senseless that should give us hearing, Totell him his commandment is fulfillâ€™d, That Rosencrantz andGuildenstern are dead. Where should we have our thanks?HORATIO. Not from his mouth, Had it thâ€™ability of life to thank you. Henever gave commandment for their death. But since, so jump upon thisbloody question, You from the Polack wars, and you from England Arehere arrivâ€™d, give order that these bodies High on a stage be placed tothe view, And let me speak to thâ€™ yet unknowing world How these thingscame about. So shall you hear Of carnal, bloody and unnatural acts, Ofaccidental judgments, casual slaughters, Of deaths put on by cunningand forcâ€™d cause, And, in this upshot, purposes mistook Fallâ€™n on theinventorsâ€™ heads. All this can I Truly deliver.FORTINBRAS. Let us haste to hear it, And call the noblest to theaudience. For me, with sorrow I embrace my fortune. I have some rightsof memory in this kingdom, Which now to claim my vantage doth inviteme.HORATIO. Of that I shall have also cause to speak, And from his mouthwhose voice will draw on more. But let this same be presentlyperformâ€™d, Even while menâ€™s minds are wild, lest more mischance Onplots and errors happen.FORTINBRAS. Let four captains Bear Hamlet like a soldier to the stage,For he was likely, had he been put on, To have provâ€™d most royally; andfor his passage, The soldiersâ€™ music and the rites of war Speak loudlyfor him. Take up the bodies. Such a sight as this Becomes the field,but here shows much amiss. Go, bid the soldiers shoot.

So frownâ€™d he once, when in anangry parle He smote the sledded Polacks on the ice.&#39;, &#39;â€™Tis strange.MARCELLUS.&#39;, &#39;Thus twice before, and jump at this dead hour, With martialstalk hath he gone by our watch.HORATIO.&#39;, &#39;In what particular thought to work I know not; But in thegross and scope of my opinion, This bodes some strange eruption to ourstate.MARCELLUS.&#39;, &#39;Good now, sit down, and tell me, he that knows, Why thissame strict and most observant watch So nightly toils the subject ofthe land, And why such daily cast of brazen cannon And foreign mart forimplements of war; Why such impress of shipwrights, whose sore taskDoes not divide the Sunday from the week.&#39;, &#39;What might be toward, thatthis sweaty haste Doth make the night joint-labourer with the day: Whoisâ€™t that can inform me?HORATIO.&#39;, &#39;That can I; At least, the whisper goes so.&#39;, &#39;Our last King,Whose image even but now appearâ€™d to us, Was, as you know, byFortinbras of Norway, Thereto prickâ€™d on by a most emulate pride, Darâ€™dto the combat; in which our valiant Hamlet, For so this side of ourknown world esteemâ€™d him, Did slay this Fortinbras; who by a sealâ€™dcompact, Well ratified by law and heraldry, Did forfeit, with his life,all those his lands Which he stood seizâ€™d of, to the conqueror; Againstthe which, a moiety competent Was gaged by our King; which had returnâ€™dTo the inheritance of Fortinbras, Had he been vanquisher; as by thesame covâ€™nant And carriage of the article designâ€™d, His fell to Hamlet.Now, sir, young Fortinbras, Of unimproved mettle, hot and full, Hath inthe skirts of Norway, here and there, Sharkâ€™d up a list of lawlessresolutes, For food and diet, to some enterprise That hath a stomachinâ€™t; which is no other, As it doth well appear unto our state, But torecover of us by strong hand And terms compulsatory, those foresaidlands So by his father lost.&#39;, &#39;And this, I take it, Is the main motive ofour preparations, The source of this our watch, and the chief head Ofthis post-haste and rummage in the land.BARNARDO.&#39;, &#39;I think it be no other but eâ€™en so: Well may it sort thatthis portentous figure Comes armed through our watch so like the KingThat was and is the question of these wars.HORATIO.&#39;, &#39;A mote it is to trouble the mindâ€™s eye.&#39;, &#39;In the most high andpalmy state of Rome, A little ere the mightiest Julius fell, The gravesstood tenantless and the sheeted dead Did squeak and gibber in theRoman streets; As stars with trains of fire and dews of blood,Disasters in the sun; and the moist star, Upon whose influenceNeptuneâ€™s empire stands, Was sick almost to doomsday with eclipse.&#39;, &#39;Andeven the like precurse of fierce events, As harbingers preceding stillthe fates And prologue to the omen coming on, Have heaven and earthtogether demonstrated Unto our climatures and countrymen.&#39;, &#39;Re-enter Ghost.But, soft, behold!&#39;, &#39;Lo, where it comes again!&#39;, &#39;Iâ€™ll cross it, though itblast me.&#39;, &#39;Stay, illusion!&#39;, &#39;If thou hast any sound, or use of voice,Speak to me.&#39;, &#39;If there be any good thing to be done, That may to thee doease, and grace to me, Speak to me.&#39;, &#39;If thou art privy to thy countryâ€™sfate, Which, happily, foreknowing may avoid, O speak!&#39;, &#39;Or if thou hastuphoarded in thy life Extorted treasure in the womb of earth, Forwhich, they say, you spirits oft walk in death, Speak of it.&#39;, &#39;Stay, andspeak!&#39;, &#39;[_The cock crows._]Stop it, Marcellus!MARCELLUS.&#39;, &#39;Shall I strike at it with my partisan?HORATIO.&#39;, &#39;Do, if it will not stand.BARNARDO.&#39;, &#39;â€™Tis here!HORATIO.&#39;, &#39;â€™Tis here!&#39;, &#39;[_Exit Ghost._]MARCELLUS.&#39;, &#39;â€™Tis gone!&#39;, &#39;We do it wrong, being so majestical, To offer itthe show of violence, For it is as the air, invulnerable, And our vainblows malicious mockery.BARNARDO.&#39;, &#39;It was about to speak, when the cock crew.HORATIO.&#39;, &#39;And then it started, like a guilty thing Upon a fearfulsummons.&#39;, &#39;I have heard The cock, that is the trumpet to the morn, Dothwith his lofty and shrill-sounding throat Awake the god of day; and athis warning, Whether in sea or fire, in earth or air, Thâ€™extravagantand erring spirit hies To his confine.&#39;, &#39;And of the truth herein Thispresent object made probation.MARCELLUS.&#39;, &#39;It faded on the crowing of the cock.&#39;, &#39;Some say that everâ€™gainst that season comes Wherein our Saviourâ€™s birth is celebrated,The bird of dawning singeth all night long; And then, they say, nospirit dare stir abroad, The nights are wholesome, then no planetsstrike, No fairy takes, nor witch hath power to charm; So hallowâ€™d andso gracious is the time.HORATIO.&#39;, &#39;So have I heard, and do in part believe it.&#39;, &#39;But look, the mornin russet mantle clad, Walks oâ€™er the dew of yon high eastward hill.Break we our watch up, and by my advice, Let us impart what we haveseen tonight Unto young Hamlet; for upon my life, This spirit, dumb tous, will speak to him.&#39;, &#39;Do you consent we shall acquaint him with it, Asneedful in our loves, fitting our duty?MARCELLUS.&#39;, &#39;Letâ€™s doâ€™t, I pray, and I this morning know Where we shallfind him most conveniently.&#39;, &#39;[_Exeunt._]SCENE II.&#39;, &#39;Elsinore.&#39;, &#39;A room of state in the Castle.&#39;, &#39;Enter Claudius King of Denmark, Gertrude the Queen, Hamlet, Polonius, Laertes, Voltemand, Cornelius, Lords and Attendant.KING.&#39;, &#39;Though yet of Hamlet our dear brotherâ€™s death The memory begreen, and that it us befitted To bear our hearts in grief, and ourwhole kingdom To be contracted in one brow of woe; Yet so far hathdiscretion fought with nature That we with wisest sorrow think on him,Together with remembrance of ourselves.&#39;, &#39;Therefore our sometime sister,now our queen, Thâ€™imperial jointress to this warlike state, Have we, asâ€™twere with a defeated joy, With one auspicious and one dropping eye,With mirth in funeral, and with dirge in marriage, In equal scaleweighing delight and dole, Taken to wife; nor have we herein barrâ€™dYour better wisdoms, which have freely gone With this affair along.&#39;, &#39;Forall, our thanks.&#39;, &#39;Now follows, that you know young Fortinbras, Holding aweak supposal of our worth, Or thinking by our late dear brotherâ€™sdeath Our state to be disjoint and out of frame, Colleagued with thisdream of his advantage, He hath not failâ€™d to pester us with message,Importing the surrender of those lands Lost by his father, with allbonds of law, To our most valiant brother.&#39;, &#39;So much for him.&#39;, &#39;Now forourself and for this time of meeting: Thus much the business is: wehave here writ To Norway, uncle of young Fortinbras, Who, impotent andbed-rid, scarcely hears Of this his nephewâ€™s purpose, to suppress Hisfurther gait herein; in that the levies, The lists, and fullproportions are all made Out of his subject: and we here dispatch You,good Cornelius, and you, Voltemand, For bearers of this greeting to oldNorway, Giving to you no further personal power To business with theKing, more than the scope Of these dilated articles allow.&#39;, &#39;Farewell;and let your haste commend your duty.CORNELIUS and VOLTEMAND.&#39;, &#39;In that, and all things, will we show ourduty.KING.&#39;, &#39;We doubt it nothing: heartily farewell.&#39;, &#39;[_Exeunt Voltemand and Cornelius._]And now, Laertes, whatâ€™s the news with you?&#39;, &#39;You told us of some suit.What isâ€™t, Laertes?&#39;, &#39;You cannot speak of reason to the Dane, And loseyour voice.&#39;, &#39;What wouldst thou beg, Laertes, That shall not be my offer,not thy asking?&#39;, &#39;The head is not more native to the heart, The hand moreinstrumental to the mouth, Than is the throne of Denmark to thy father.What wouldst thou have, Laertes?LAERTES.&#39;, &#39;Dread my lord, Your leave and favour to return to France, Fromwhence though willingly I came to Denmark To show my duty in yourcoronation; Yet now I must confess, that duty done, My thoughts andwishes bend again toward France, And bow them to your gracious leaveand pardon.KING.&#39;, &#39;Have you your fatherâ€™s leave?&#39;, &#39;What says Polonius?POLONIUS.&#39;, &#39;He hath, my lord, wrung from me my slow leave By laboursomepetition; and at last Upon his will I sealâ€™d my hard consent.&#39;, &#39;I dobeseech you give him leave to go.KING.&#39;, &#39;Take thy fair hour, Laertes; time be thine, And thy best gracesspend it at thy will!&#39;, &#39;But now, my cousin Hamlet, and my sonâ€”HAMLET.&#39;, &#39;[_Aside._] A little more than kin, and less than kind.KING.&#39;, &#39;How is it that the clouds still hang on you?HAMLET.&#39;, &#39;Not so, my lord, I am too much iâ€™ the sun.QUEEN.&#39;, &#39;Good Hamlet, cast thy nighted colour off, And let thine eye looklike a friend on Denmark.&#39;, &#39;Do not for ever with thy vailed lids Seek forthy noble father in the dust.&#39;, &#39;Thou knowâ€™st â€™tis common, all that livesmust die, Passing through nature to eternity.HAMLET.&#39;, &#39;Ay, madam, it is common.QUEEN.&#39;, &#39;If it be, Why seems it so particular with thee?HAMLET.&#39;, &#39;Seems, madam!&#39;, &#39;Nay, it is; I know not seems.&#39;, &#39;â€™Tis not alone myinky cloak, good mother, Nor customary suits of solemn black, Nor windysuspiration of forcâ€™d breath, No, nor the fruitful river in the eye,Nor the dejected haviour of the visage, Together with all forms, moods,shows of grief, That can denote me truly.&#39;, &#39;These indeed seem, For theyare actions that a man might play; But I have that within which passethshow; These but the trappings and the suits of woe.KING.&#39;, &#39;â€™Tis sweet and commendable in your nature, Hamlet, To give thesemourning duties to your father; But you must know, your father lost afather, That father lost, lost his, and the survivor bound In filialobligation, for some term To do obsequious sorrow.&#39;, &#39;But to persevere Inobstinate condolement is a course Of impious stubbornness.&#39;, &#39;â€™Tis unmanlygrief, It shows a will most incorrect to heaven, A heart unfortified, amind impatient, An understanding simple and unschoolâ€™d; For what weknow must be, and is as common As any the most vulgar thing to sense,Why should we in our peevish opposition Take it to heart?&#39;, &#39;Fie, â€™tis afault to heaven, A fault against the dead, a fault to nature, To reasonmost absurd, whose common theme Is death of fathers, and who still hathcried, From the first corse till he that died today, â€˜This must be so.â€™We pray you throw to earth This unprevailing woe, and think of us As ofa father; for let the world take note You are the most immediate to ourthrone, And with no less nobility of love Than that which dearestfather bears his son Do I impart toward you.&#39;, &#39;For your intent In goingback to school in Wittenberg, It is most retrograde to our desire: Andwe beseech you bend you to remain Here in the cheer and comfort of oureye, Our chiefest courtier, cousin, and our son.QUEEN.&#39;, &#39;Let not thy mother lose her prayers, Hamlet.&#39;, &#39;I pray thee staywith us; go not to Wittenberg.HAMLET.&#39;, &#39;I shall in all my best obey you, madam.KING.&#39;, &#39;Why, â€™tis a loving and a fair reply.&#39;, &#39;Be as ourself in Denmark.Madam, come; This gentle and unforcâ€™d accord of Hamlet Sits smiling tomy heart; in grace whereof, No jocund health that Denmark drinks todayBut the great cannon to the clouds shall tell, And the Kingâ€™s rouse theheaven shall bruit again, Re-speaking earthly thunder.&#39;, &#39;Come away.&#39;, &#39;[_Exeunt all but Hamlet._]HAMLET.&#39;, &#39;O that this too too solid flesh would melt, Thaw, and resolveitself into a dew!&#39;, &#39;Or that the Everlasting had not fixâ€™d His canonâ€™gainst self-slaughter.&#39;, &#39;O God!&#39;, &#39;O God!&#39;, &#39;How weary, stale, flat, andunprofitable Seem to me all the uses of this world!&#39;, &#39;Fie onâ€™t!&#39;, &#39;Oh fie!â€™tis an unweeded garden That grows to seed; things rank and gross innature Possess it merely.&#39;, &#39;That it should come to this!&#39;, &#39;But two monthsdeadâ€”nay, not so much, not two: So excellent a king; that was to thisHyperion to a satyr; so loving to my mother, That he might not beteemthe winds of heaven Visit her face too roughly.&#39;, &#39;Heaven and earth!&#39;, &#39;MustI remember?&#39;, &#39;Why, she would hang on him As if increase of appetite hadgrown By what it fed on; and yet, within a monthâ€” Let me not thinkonâ€™tâ€”Frailty, thy name is woman!&#39;, &#39;A little month, or ere those shoeswere old With which she followed my poor fatherâ€™s body Like Niobe, alltears.â€”Why she, even sheâ€” O God!&#39;, &#39;A beast that wants discourse of reasonWould have mournâ€™d longer,â€”married with mine uncle, My fatherâ€™sbrother; but no more like my father Than I to Hercules.&#39;, &#39;Within a month?Ere yet the salt of most unrighteous tears Had left the flushing in hergalled eyes, She married.&#39;, &#39;O most wicked speed, to post With suchdexterity to incestuous sheets!&#39;, &#39;It is not, nor it cannot come to good.But break my heart, for I must hold my tongue.&#39;, &#39;Enter Horatio, Marcellus and Barnardo.HORATIO.&#39;, &#39;Hail to your lordship!HAMLET.&#39;, &#39;I am glad to see you well: Horatio, or I do forget myself.HORATIO.&#39;, &#39;The same, my lord, And your poor servant ever.HAMLET.&#39;, &#39;Sir, my good friend; Iâ€™ll change that name with you: And whatmake you from Wittenberg, Horatio?â€” Marcellus?MARCELLUS.&#39;, &#39;My good lord.HAMLET.&#39;, &#39;I am very glad to see you.â€”Good even, sir.â€” But what, in faith,make you from Wittenberg?HORATIO.&#39;, &#39;A truant disposition, good my lord.HAMLET.&#39;, &#39;I would not hear your enemy say so; Nor shall you do my earthat violence, To make it truster of your own report Against yourself.I know you are no truant.&#39;, &#39;But what is your affair in Elsinore?&#39;, &#39;Weâ€™llteach you to drink deep ere you depart.HORATIO.&#39;, &#39;My lord, I came to see your fatherâ€™s funeral.HAMLET.&#39;, &#39;I prithee do not mock me, fellow-student.&#39;, &#39;I think it was to seemy motherâ€™s wedding.HORATIO.&#39;, &#39;Indeed, my lord, it followâ€™d hard upon.HAMLET.&#39;, &#39;Thrift, thrift, Horatio!&#39;, &#39;The funeral bakâ€™d meats Did coldlyfurnish forth the marriage tables.&#39;, &#39;Would I had met my dearest foe inheaven Or ever I had seen that day, Horatio.&#39;, &#39;My father,â€”methinks I seemy father.HORATIO.&#39;, &#39;Where, my lord?HAMLET.&#39;, &#39;In my mindâ€™s eye, Horatio.HORATIO.&#39;, &#39;I saw him once; he was a goodly king.HAMLET.&#39;, &#39;He was a man, take him for all in all, I shall not look uponhis like again.HORATIO.&#39;, &#39;My lord, I think I saw him yesternight.HAMLET.&#39;, &#39;Saw?&#39;, &#39;Who?HORATIO.&#39;, &#39;My lord, the King your father.HAMLET.&#39;, &#39;The King my father!HORATIO.&#39;, &#39;Season your admiration for a while With an attent ear, till Imay deliver Upon the witness of these gentlemen This marvel to you.HAMLET.&#39;, &#39;For Godâ€™s love let me hear.HORATIO.&#39;, &#39;Two nights together had these gentlemen, Marcellus andBarnardo, on their watch In the dead waste and middle of the night,Been thus encounterâ€™d.&#39;, &#39;A figure like your father, Armed at pointexactly, cap-Ã xa0-pie, Appears before them, and with solemn march Goesslow and stately by them: thrice he walkâ€™d By their oppressâ€™d andfear-surprised eyes, Within his truncheonâ€™s length; whilst they,distillâ€™d Almost to jelly with the act of fear, Stand dumb, and speaknot to him.&#39;, &#39;This to me In dreadful secrecy impart they did, And I withthem the third night kept the watch, Where, as they had deliverâ€™d, bothin time, Form of the thing, each word made true and good, Theapparition comes.&#39;, &#39;I knew your father; These hands are not more like.HAMLET.&#39;, &#39;But where was this?MARCELLUS.&#39;, &#39;My lord, upon the platform where we watch.HAMLET.&#39;, &#39;Did you not speak to it?HORATIO.&#39;, &#39;My lord, I did; But answer made it none: yet once methought Itlifted up it head, and did address Itself to motion, like as it wouldspeak.&#39;, &#39;But even then the morning cock crew loud, And at the sound itshrunk in haste away, And vanishâ€™d from our sight.HAMLET.&#39;, &#39;â€™Tis very strange.HORATIO.&#39;, &#39;As I do live, my honourâ€™d lord, â€™tis true; And we did think itwrit down in our duty To let you know of it.HAMLET.&#39;, &#39;Indeed, indeed, sirs, but this troubles me.&#39;, &#39;Hold you the watchtonight?Mar.&#39;, &#39;and BARNARDO.&#39;, &#39;We do, my lord.HAMLET.&#39;, &#39;Armâ€™d, say you?Both.&#39;, &#39;Armâ€™d, my lord.HAMLET.&#39;, &#39;From top to toe?BOTH.&#39;, &#39;My lord, from head to foot.HAMLET.&#39;, &#39;Then saw you not his face?HORATIO.&#39;, &#39;O yes, my lord, he wore his beaver up.HAMLET.&#39;, &#39;What, lookâ€™d he frowningly?HORATIO.&#39;, &#39;A countenance more in sorrow than in anger.HAMLET.&#39;, &#39;Pale, or red?HORATIO.&#39;, &#39;Nay, very pale.HAMLET.&#39;, &#39;And fixâ€™d his eyes upon you?HORATIO.&#39;, &#39;Most constantly.HAMLET.&#39;, &#39;I would I had been there.HORATIO.&#39;, &#39;It would have much amazâ€™d you.HAMLET.&#39;, &#39;Very like, very like.&#39;, &#39;Stayâ€™d it long?HORATIO.&#39;, &#39;While one with moderate haste might tell a hundred.MARCELLUS and BARNARDO.&#39;, &#39;Longer, longer.HORATIO.&#39;, &#39;Not when I sawâ€™t.HAMLET.&#39;, &#39;His beard was grizzled, no?HORATIO.&#39;, &#39;It was, as I have seen it in his life, A sable silverâ€™d.HAMLET.&#39;, &#39;I will watch tonight; Perchance â€™twill walk again.HORATIO.&#39;, &#39;I warrant you it will.HAMLET.&#39;, &#39;If it assume my noble fatherâ€™s person, Iâ€™ll speak to it, thoughhell itself should gape And bid me hold my peace.&#39;, &#39;I pray you all, Ifyou have hitherto concealâ€™d this sight, Let it be tenable in yoursilence still; And whatsoever else shall hap tonight, Give it anunderstanding, but no tongue.&#39;, &#39;I will requite your loves.&#39;, &#39;So, fare yewell.&#39;, &#39;Upon the platform â€™twixt eleven and twelve, Iâ€™ll visit you.ALL.&#39;, &#39;Our duty to your honour.HAMLET.&#39;, &#39;Your loves, as mine to you: farewell.&#39;, &#39;[_Exeunt Horatio, Marcellus and Barnardo._]My fatherâ€™s spirit in arms!&#39;, &#39;All is not well;

A violet in the youth of primy nature, Forward, notpermanent, sweet, not lasting; The perfume and suppliance of a minute;No more.OPHELIA.&#39;, &#39;No more but so?LAERTES.&#39;, &#39;Think it no more.&#39;, &#39;For nature crescent does not grow alone Inthews and bulk; but as this temple waxes, The inward service of themind and soul Grows wide withal.&#39;, &#39;Perhaps he loves you now, And now nosoil nor cautel doth besmirch The virtue of his will; but you mustfear, His greatness weighâ€™d, his will is not his own; For he himself issubject to his birth: He may not, as unvaluâ€™d persons do, Carve forhimself; for on his choice depends The sanctity and health of thiswhole state; And therefore must his choice be circumscribâ€™d Unto thevoice and yielding of that body Whereof he is the head.&#39;, &#39;Then if he sayshe loves you, It fits your wisdom so far to believe it As he in hisparticular act and place May give his saying deed; which is no furtherThan the main voice of Denmark goes withal.&#39;, &#39;Then weigh what loss yourhonour may sustain If with too credent ear you list his songs, Or loseyour heart, or your chaste treasure open To his unmasterâ€™d importunity.Fear it, Ophelia, fear it, my dear sister; And keep you in the rear ofyour affection, Out of the shot and danger of desire.&#39;, &#39;The chariest maidis prodigal enough If she unmask her beauty to the moon.&#39;, &#39;Virtue itselfscopes not calumnious strokes: The canker galls the infants of thespring Too oft before their buttons be disclosâ€™d, And in the morn andliquid dew of youth Contagious blastments are most imminent.&#39;, &#39;Be warythen, best safety lies in fear.&#39;, &#39;Youth to itself rebels, though noneelse near.OPHELIA.&#39;, &#39;I shall thâ€™effect of this good lesson keep As watchman to myheart.&#39;, &#39;But good my brother, Do not as some ungracious pastors do, Showme the steep and thorny way to heaven; Whilst like a puffâ€™d andreckless libertine Himself the primrose path of dalliance treads, Andrecks not his own rede.LAERTES.&#39;, &#39;O, fear me not.&#39;, &#39;I stay too long.&#39;, &#39;But here my father comes.&#39;, &#39;Enter Polonius.A double blessing is a double grace;

But donot dull thy palm with entertainment Of each new-hatchâ€™d, unfledgâ€™dcomrade.&#39;, &#39;Beware Of entrance to a quarrel; but being in, Bearâ€™t thatthâ€™opposed may beware of thee.&#39;, &#39;Give every man thine ear, but few thyvoice: Take each manâ€™s censure, but reserve thy judgment.&#39;, &#39;Costly thyhabit as thy purse can buy, But not expressâ€™d in fancy; rich, notgaudy: For the apparel oft proclaims the man; And they in France of thebest rank and station Are of a most select and generous chief in that.Neither a borrower nor a lender be: For loan oft loses both itself andfriend; And borrowing dulls the edge of husbandry.&#39;, &#39;This above all: tothine own self be true; And it must follow, as the night the day, Thoucanst not then be false to any man.&#39;, &#39;Farewell: my blessing season thisin thee.LAERTES.&#39;, &#39;Most humbly do I take my leave, my lord.POLONIUS.&#39;, &#39;The time invites you;

and you yourself Have of your audience beenmost free and bounteous.&#39;, &#39;If it be so,â€”as so â€™tis put on me, And that inway of caution,â€”I must tell you You do not understand yourself soclearly As it behoves my daughter and your honour.&#39;, &#39;What is between you?Give me up the truth.OPHELIA.&#39;, &#39;He hath, my lord, of late made many tenders Of his affectionto me.POLONIUS.&#39;, &#39;Affection!&#39;, &#39;Pooh!&#39;, &#39;You speak like a green girl, Unsifted insuch perilous circumstance.&#39;, &#39;Do you believe his tenders, as you callthem?OPHELIA.&#39;, &#39;I do not know, my lord, what I should think.POLONIUS.&#39;, &#39;Marry, Iâ€™ll teach you; think yourself a baby; That you havetaâ€™en these tenders for true pay, Which are not sterling.&#39;, &#39;Tenderyourself more dearly; Or,â€”not to crack the wind of the poor phrase,Roaming it thus,â€”youâ€™ll tender me a fool.OPHELIA.&#39;, &#39;My lord, he hath importunâ€™d me with love In honourablefashion.POLONIUS.&#39;, &#39;Ay, fashion you may call it; go to, go to.OPHELIA.&#39;, &#39;And hath given countenance to his speech, my lord, With almostall the holy vows of heaven.POLONIUS.&#39;, &#39;Ay, springes to catch woodcocks.&#39;, &#39;I do know, When the bloodburns, how prodigal the soul Lends the tongue vows: these blazes,daughter, Giving more light than heat, extinct in both, Even in theirpromise, as it is a-making, You must not take for fire.&#39;, &#39;From this timeBe something scanter of your maiden presence; Set your entreatments ata higher rate Than a command to parley.&#39;, &#39;For Lord Hamlet, Believe somuch in him that he is young; And with a larger tether may he walk Thanmay be given you.&#39;, &#39;In few, Ophelia, Do not believe his vows; for theyare brokers, Not of that dye which their investments show, But mereimplorators of unholy suits, Breathing like sanctified and pious bawds,The better to beguile.&#39;, &#39;This is for all.&#39;, &#39;I would not, in plain terms,from this time forth Have you so slander any moment leisure As to givewords or talk with the Lord Hamlet.&#39;, &#39;Look toâ€™t, I charge you;

And as he drains his draughts ofRhenish down, The kettle-drum and trumpet thus bray out The triumph ofhis pledge.HORATIO.&#39;, &#39;Is it a custom?HAMLET.&#39;, &#39;Ay marry isâ€™t; And to my mind, though I am native here, And tothe manner born, it is a custom More honourâ€™d in the breach than theobservance.&#39;, &#39;This heavy-headed revel east and west Makes us traducâ€™d andtaxâ€™d of other nations: They clepe us drunkards, and with swinishphrase Soil our addition;

why the sepulchre, Wherein we saw thee quietly inurnâ€™d, Hathopâ€™d his ponderous and marble jaws To cast thee up again!&#39;, &#39;What may thismean, That thou, dead corse, again in complete steel, Revisitâ€™st thusthe glimpses of the moon, Making night hideous, and we fools of natureSo horridly to shake our disposition With thoughts beyond the reachesof our souls?&#39;, &#39;Say, why is this?&#39;, &#39;Wherefore?&#39;, &#39;What should we do?&#39;, &#39;[_Ghost beckons Hamlet._]HORATIO.&#39;, &#39;It beckons you to go away with it, As if it some impartmentdid desire To you alone.MARCELLUS.&#39;, &#39;Look with what courteous action It waves you to a moreremoved ground.&#39;, &#39;But do not go with it.HORATIO.&#39;, &#39;No, by no means.HAMLET.&#39;, &#39;It will not speak;

freeze thy young blood,Make thy two eyes like stars start from their spheres, Thy knotted andcombined locks to part, And each particular hair to stand on end Likequills upon the fretful porcupine.&#39;, &#39;But this eternal blazon must not beTo ears of flesh and blood.&#39;, &#39;List, list, O, list!&#39;, &#39;If thou didst ever thydear father loveâ€”HAMLET.&#39;, &#39;O God!GHOST.&#39;, &#39;Revenge his foul and most unnatural murder.HAMLET.&#39;, &#39;Murder!GHOST.&#39;, &#39;Murder most foul, as in the best it is;

And duller shouldst thou be than the fat weedThat rots itself in ease on Lethe wharf, Wouldst thou not stir in this.Now, Hamlet, hear.&#39;, &#39;â€™Tis given out that, sleeping in my orchard, Aserpent stung me; so the whole ear of Denmark Is by a forged process ofmy death Rankly abusâ€™d; but know, thou noble youth, The serpent thatdid sting thy fatherâ€™s life Now wears his crown.HAMLET.&#39;, &#39;O my prophetic soul!&#39;, &#39;Mine uncle!GHOST.&#39;, &#39;Ay, that incestuous, that adulterate beast, With witchcraft ofhis wit, with traitorous gifts,â€” O wicked wit, and gifts, that have thepower So to seduce!â€”won to his shameful lust The will of my mostseeming-virtuous queen.&#39;, &#39;O Hamlet, what a falling off was there, Fromme, whose love was of that dignity That it went hand in hand even withthe vow I made to her in marriage; and to decline Upon a wretch whosenatural gifts were poor To those of mine.&#39;, &#39;But virtue, as it never willbe movâ€™d, Though lewdness court it in a shape of heaven; So lust,though to a radiant angel linkâ€™d, Will sate itself in a celestial bedAnd prey on garbage.&#39;, &#39;But soft!&#39;, &#39;methinks I scent the morning air; Brieflet me be.&#39;, &#39;Sleeping within my orchard, My custom always of theafternoon, Upon my secure hour thy uncle stole With juice of cursedhebenon in a vial, And in the porches of my ears did pour The leperousdistilment, whose effect Holds such an enmity with blood of man Thatswift as quicksilver it courses through The natural gates and alleys ofthe body; And with a sudden vigour it doth posset And curd, like eagerdroppings into milk, The thin and wholesome blood.&#39;, &#39;So did it mine; Anda most instant tetter barkâ€™d about, Most lazar-like, with vile andloathsome crust All my smooth body.&#39;, &#39;Thus was I, sleeping, by abrotherâ€™s hand, Of life, of crown, of queen at once dispatchâ€™d: Cut offeven in the blossoms of my sin, Unhousâ€™led, disappointed, unanelâ€™d; Noreckoning made, but sent to my account With all my imperfections on myhead.&#39;, &#39;O horrible!&#39;, &#39;O horrible!&#39;, &#39;most horrible!&#39;, &#39;If thou hast nature inthee, bear it not; Let not the royal bed of Denmark be A couch forluxury and damned incest.&#39;, &#39;But howsoever thou pursuâ€™st this act, Taintnot thy mind, nor let thy soul contrive Against thy mother aught; leaveher to heaven, And to those thorns that in her bosom lodge, To prickand sting her.&#39;, &#39;Fare thee well at once!&#39;, &#39;The glow-worm shows the matin tobe near, And â€™gins to pale his uneffectual fire.&#39;, &#39;Adieu, adieu, adieu.Hamlet, remember me.&#39;, &#39;[_Exit._]HAMLET.&#39;, &#39;O all you host of heaven!&#39;, &#39;O earth!&#39;, &#39;What else?&#39;, &#39;And shall Icouple hell?&#39;, &#39;O, fie!&#39;, &#39;Hold, my heart;

Where littlefears grow great, great love grows there.PLAYER KING.&#39;, &#39;Faith, I must leave thee, love, and shortly too: Myoperant powers their functions leave to do: And thou shalt live in thisfair world behind, Honourâ€™d, belovâ€™d, and haply one as kind For husbandshalt thouâ€”PLAYER QUEEN.&#39;, &#39;O confound the rest.&#39;, &#39;Such love must needs be treason inmy breast.&#39;, &#39;In second husband let me be accurst!&#39;, &#39;None wed the second butwho killâ€™d the first.HAMLET.&#39;, &#39;[_Aside._] Wormwood, wormwood.PLAYER QUEEN.&#39;, &#39;The instances that second marriage move Are base respectsof thrift, but none of love.&#39;, &#39;A second time I kill my husband dead, Whensecond husband kisses me in bed.PLAYER KING.&#39;, &#39;I do believe you think what now you speak; But what we dodetermine, oft we break.&#39;, &#39;Purpose is but the slave to memory, Of violentbirth, but poor validity: Which now, like fruit unripe, sticks on thetree, But fall unshaken when they mellow be.&#39;, &#39;Most necessary â€™tis thatwe forget To pay ourselves what to ourselves is debt.&#39;, &#39;What to ourselvesin passion we propose, The passion ending, doth the purpose lose.&#39;, &#39;Theviolence of either grief or joy Their own enactures with themselvesdestroy.&#39;, &#39;Where joy most revels, grief doth most lament; Grief joys, joygrieves, on slender accident.&#39;, &#39;This world is not for aye; nor â€™tis notstrange That even our loves should with our fortunes change, For â€™tis aquestion left us yet to prove, Whether love lead fortune, or elsefortune love.&#39;, &#39;The great man down, you mark his favourite flies, Thepoor advancâ€™d makes friends of enemies; And hitherto doth love onfortune tend: For who not needs shall never lack a friend, And who inwant a hollow friend doth try, Directly seasons him his enemy.&#39;, &#39;Butorderly to end where I begun, Our wills and fates do so contrary runThat our devices still are overthrown.&#39;, &#39;Our thoughts are ours, theirends none of our own.&#39;, &#39;So think thou wilt no second husband wed, But diethy thoughts when thy first lord is dead.PLAYER QUEEN.&#39;, &#39;Nor earth to me give food, nor heaven light, Sport andrepose lock from me day and night, To desperation turn my trust andhope, An anchorâ€™s cheer in prison be my scope, Each opposite thatblanks the face of joy, Meet what I would have well, and it destroy!Both here and hence pursue me lasting strife, If, once a widow, ever Ibe wife.HAMLET.&#39;, &#39;[_To Ophelia._] If she should break it now.PLAYER KING.&#39;, &#39;â€™Tis deeply sworn.&#39;, &#39;Sweet, leave me here awhile.&#39;, &#39;My spiritsgrow dull, and fain I would beguile The tedious day with sleep.&#39;, &#39;[_Sleeps._]PLAYER QUEEN.&#39;, &#39;Sleep rock thy brain, And never come mischance between ustwain.&#39;, &#39;[_Exit._]HAMLET.&#39;, &#39;Madam, how like you this play?QUEEN.&#39;, &#39;The lady protests too much, methinks.HAMLET.&#39;, &#39;O, but sheâ€™ll keep her word.KING.&#39;, &#39;Have you heard the argument?&#39;, &#39;Is there no offence inâ€™t?HAMLET.&#39;, &#39;No, no, they do but jest, poison in jest;

With fastpages you can save your jupyter notebooks into the _notebooks folder at the root of your repository, and they will be automatically be converted to Jekyll compliant blog posts! . Front Matter . The first cell in your Jupyter Notebook or markdown blog post contains front matter. Front matter is metadata that can turn on/off options in your Notebook. It is formatted like this: . # &quot;My Title&quot; &gt; &quot;Awesome summary&quot; - toc:true- branch: master - badges: true - comments: true - author: Hamel Husain &amp; Jeremy Howard - categories: [fastpages, jupyter] . Setting toc: true will automatically generate a table of contents | Setting badges: true will automatically include GitHub and Google Colab links to your notebook. | Setting comments: true will enable commenting on your blog post, powered by utterances. | . The title and description need to be enclosed in double quotes only if they include special characters such as a colon. More details and options for front matter can be viewed on the front matter section of the README. . Markdown Shortcuts . A #hide comment at the top of any code cell will hide both the input and output of that cell in your blog post. . A #hide_input comment at the top of any code cell will only hide the input of that cell. .

Where YEAR is a four-digit number, MONTH and DAY are both two-digit numbers, and filename is whatever file name you choose, to remind yourself what this post is about. .md is the file extension for markdown files. . The first line of the file should start with a single hash character, then a space, then your title. This is how you create a “level 1 heading” in markdown. Then you can create level 2, 3, etc headings as you wish but repeating the hash character, such as you see in the line ## File names above. . Basic formatting . You can use italics, bold, code font text, and create links. Here’s a footnote 1. Here’s a horizontal rule: . . Lists . Here’s a list: . item 1 | item 2 | . And a numbered list: . item 1 | item 2 | Boxes and stuff . This is a quotation . . You can include alert boxes …and… . . You can include info boxes Images . . Code . You can format text and code per usual . General preformatted text: . # Do a thing do_thing() . Python code and output: . # Prints &#39;2&#39; print(1+1) . 2 .
